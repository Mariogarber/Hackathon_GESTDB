A good example of such a dynamical system is the box with particles evolving according to Newton's laws with elastic collisions, like in the video.\n\n2) This video assumes that all probability distributions are discrete, which is the case in the simulations. But one can also set up this formalism for systems with continuous state spaces. Again, a good example is particles in a box, which are not restricted to a lattice, which is only used for visualization purposes in this video.\n\n3) Strictly speaking, these \"derivatives\" don't make sense since in our simulations the energy can only take on a discrete set of values. But a derivative is the right way to think about this, and is the correct notion in a limiting sense.\n\n4) The factor of -T in the definition of the chemical potential is sort of a historical leftover, but including it has the convenient side effect of allowing the same Boltzmann formula to hold, with an energy function that depends on the chemical potential as well. It should also be noted that temperature must equalize in any situation where the chemical potential equalizes, since it is impossible for systems to exchange molecules without also exchanging energy.\n\n5) This algorithm, where we only choose one pixel at a time, is called Glauber dynamics. There are multiple ways to parallelize it, but the method chosen in this video is to only update each pixel with a low probability at each call of the compute shader, to avoid (frequently) updating two neighboring pixels simultaneously. One could also alternate between updating the even or odd pixels at each step.\n\n6) By \"zooming out,\" what is meant, technically, is a renormalization operation whereby each 3x3 grid of pixels is replaced by just one pixel, which has a molecule exactly when 5 or more of the pixels in the 3x3 grid have molecules. But that is somewhat tough to simulate as the size has to increase by 9 at each step, so this video cheats a bit by just zooming out on a large simulation.\n\n7) The \"interesting behavior\" referenced here is the fact that the interface between the up and down sections of the picture can be rescaled (as the size of the model goes to infinity) in a way that yields a universal random curve called Schramm-Loewner evolution.

For this reason, we animated these vectors as orthogonal-ish. See: https:\/\/proceedings.mlr.press\/v119\/wang20k\/wang20k.pdf\n\nPer Chenyang Yuan: at 10:15, the blurry image that results when removing random noise in DDPM is probably due to a mismatch in noise levels when calling the denoiser. When the denoiser is called on x_{t-1} during DDPM sampling, it is expected to have a certain noise level (let's call it sigma_{t-1}). If you generate x_{t-1} from x_t without adding noise, then the noise present in x_{t-1} is always smaller than sigma_{t-1}. This causes the denoiser to remove too much noise, thus pointing towards the mean of the dataset. \n\nThe text conditioning input to stable diffusion is not the 512-dim text embedding vector, but the output of the layer before that, [with dimension 77x512](https:\/\/stackoverflow.com\/a\/79243065)\n\nFor the vectors at 31:40 - Some implementations use f(x, t, cat) + alpha(f(x, t, cat) - f(x, t)), and some that do f(x, t) + alpha(f(x, t, cat) - f(x, t)), where an alpha value of 1 corresponds to no guidance. I chose the second format here to keep things simpler.\n\nAt 30:30, the unconditional t=1 vector field looks a bit different from what it did at the 17:15 mark. This is the result of different models trained for different parts of the video, and likely a result of different random initializations.\n\n\nPremium Beat Music ID: EEDYZ3FP44YX8OWT","language":"en","published_at":1753445651000,"view_count":1273481,"like_count":48984,"comment_count":1644,"duration":2240,"thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/iv-5mZ_9CPY\/default.jpg","width":120,"height":90},"medium":{"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/iv-5mZ_9CPY\/mqdefault.jpg","width":320,"height":180},"high":{"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/iv-5mZ_9CPY\/hqdefault.jpg","width":480,"height":360},"standard":{"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/iv-5mZ_9CPY\/sddefault.jpg","width":640,"height":480},"maxres":{"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/iv-5mZ_9CPY\/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280,"height":720}},"tags":["Mathematics","three blue one brown","3 blue 1 brown","3b1b","3brown1blue","3 brown 1 blue","three brown one blue"],"video_category_id":27,"video_category":"Education","summary":"This is a guest video by Welch Labs.

He mentioned the earliest reference he knows for the tile puzzles is David and Tomei's AMM article titled \"The problem of Calissons.\"\n\nThe idea to include the tetrahedron volume example was based on a conversation with Po Shen Lo about these puzzles, during which he mentioned the case of one dimension lower.\n\nI received the cone correction to the proof of Monge's theorem from Akos Zahorsky via email. Also, the Bulgarian team leader Velian Velikov brought up the same argument, and just shot me a message saying \"I came across it in a book I found online titled 'Mathematical Puzzles' by Peter Winkler. There, it is attributed to Nathan Bowler\"\n\nI referenced quaternions at the end, and if you're curious to learn more, here are a few options.\n\nThis is a nice talk targetted at game developers:\nhttps:\/\/youtu.be\/en2QcehKJd8\n\nThis video walks through concretely what the computation is for using quaternions to compute 3d rotations: \nhttps:\/\/youtu.be\/-zsnHbQyRnc\n\nMy own video on the topic is mainly focused on understanding what they do up in four dimensions, which is not strictly necessary for using them, but for math nerds like me may be satisfying:\nhttps:\/\/youtu.be\/d4EgbgTm0Bg\n\nAlso, one of the coolest projects I've ever done was a collaboration with Ben Eater to make interactive videos based on that topic:\nhttps:\/\/eater.net\/quaternions\n\nTimestamps\n- 0:00 - Intro\n- 0:32 - Twirling tiles\n- 6:45 - Tarski Plank Problem\n- 10:24 - Monge\u2019s Theorem \n- 17:26 - 3D Volume, 4D answer\n- 18:51 - The hypercube stack\n- 25:52 - The sadness of higher dimensions\n\n\nSEV#3: https:\/\/youtu.be\/vXBtyYvMx24\n\n------------------\n\nThese animations are largely made using a custom Python library, manim.

I describe O(N^2) as meaning \"the number of operations needed scales with N^2\". However, this is technically what Theta(N^2) would mean. O(N^2) would mean that the number of operations needed is at most constant times N^2, in particular, it includes algorithms whose runtimes don't actually have any N^2 term, but which are bounded by it. The distinction doesn't matter in this case, since there is an explicit N^2 term.\n\nThanks to these viewers for their contributions to translations\nHebrew: Omer Tuchfeld\nItalian: Emanuele Vezzoli\nVietnamese: lkhphuc\n\n--------\n\nThese animations are largely made using a custom python library, manim.

(By \"allowable\", here, I mean a residue class whose elements are coprime to the modulus, as described in the video).  What he actually showed is that the sum of the reciprocals of all primes in a given allowable residue class diverges, which proves that there are infinitely many primes in such a sequence.\n\nDirichlet observed this equal distribution numerically and noted this in his paper, but it wasn't until decades later that this fact was properly proved, as it required building on some of the work of Riemann in his famous 1859 paper.  If I'm not mistaken, I think it wasn't until Vall\u00e9e Poussin in (1899), with a version of the prime number theorem for residue classes like this, but I could be wrong there.\n\nIn many ways, this was a very silly error for me to have let through.  It is true that this result was proven with heavy use of complex analysis, and in fact, it's in a complex analysis lecture that I remember first learning about it.  But of course, this would have to have happened after Dirichlet because it would have to have happened after Riemann!\n\nMy apologies for the mistake.

Since the speed of light is so drastically greater than the speed of things being detected, the Fourier representation for pulse echoes of different objects would almost certainly overlap unless it was played for a very long time.  In effect, this is what happens, since one does not send out a single pulse, but a whole bunch of evenly spaced pulses as some pulse repetition frequency (or PRF).  \n\nThis means the Fourier representation of all those pulses together can actually be quite sharp.  Assuming a large number of such pulses, it will look like several vertical lines spaced out by the PRF.  As long as the pulses are far enough apart that the echoes of multiple objects on the field from different targets don't overlap, it's not a problem for position determinations that the full sequence of pulses occupies such a long duration.  However, the trade-off now comes in choosing the right PRF.

Thanks for the catch!\n\n*Note on conventions:  Throughout this video, I use a single-headed right arrow to represent the horizontal direction.  The standard in quantum mechanics is actually to use double-headed arrows for describing polarization states, while single-headed arrows are typically reserved for the context of spin.\n\nWhat's the difference?  Well, using a double-headed arrow to represent the horizontal direction emphasizes that in a quantum mechanical context, there's no distinction between left and right.  They each have the same measurable state: horizontal (e.g. they pass through horizontally oriented filters).  Once you're in QM, these kets are typically vectors in a more abstract space where vectors are not necessarily spatial directions but instead represent any kind of state.\n\nBecause of how I chose to motivate things with classical waves, where it makes sense for this arrow to represent a unit vector in the right direction, rather than the more abstract idea of a horizontal state vector, I chose to stick with the single-headed notation throughout, though this runs slightly against convention.\n\nMusic by Vincent Rubinetti:\nhttps:\/\/vincerubinetti.bandcamp.com\/album\/the-music-of-3blue1brown\n\nThanks to these viewers for their contributions to translations\nHebrew: Omer Tuchfeld\n\n------------------\n\n3blue1brown is a channel about animating math, in all senses of the word animate.

The example to have in mind is some *very* rough curve, which just so happens to achieve roughness level exactly 2.  Slightly rough might be around 1.1-dimension; quite rough could be 1.5; but a very rough curve could get up to 2.0 (or more).  A classic example of this is the boundary of the Mandelbrot set.  The Sierpinski pyramid also has dimension 2 (try computing it!).\n\nThe proper definition of a fractal, at least as Mandelbrot wrote it, is a shape whose \"Hausdorff dimension\" is greater than its \"topological dimension\".  Hausdorff dimension is similar to the box-counting one I showed in this video, in some sense counting using balls instead of boxes, and it coincides with box-counting dimension in many cases. But it's more general, at the cost of being a bit harder to describe.  \n\nTopological dimension is something that's always an integer, wherein (loosely speaking) curve-ish things are 1-dimensional, surface-ish things are two-dimensional, etc.  For example, a Koch Curve has topological dimension 1, and Hausdorff dimension 1.262.  A rough surface might have topological dimension 2, but fractal dimension  2.3.  And if a curve with topological dimension 1 has a Hausdorff dimension that *happens* to be exactly 2, or 3, or 4, etc., it would be considered a fractal, even though it's fractal dimension is an integer.\n\nSee Mandelbrot's book \"The Fractal Geometry of Nature\" for the full details and more examples.\n\nMusic by Vince Rubinetti: https:\/\/soundcloud.com\/vincerubinetti\/riemann-zeta-function\n\nThanks to these viewers for their contributions to translations\nHebrew: Omer Tuchfeld\n\n------------------\n3blue1brown is a channel about animating math, in all senses of the word animate.
