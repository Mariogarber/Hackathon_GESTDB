A big thank you for the incredible people without whom we couldn't have done this! 🖤

To Michael Greenburg, author of The Great Miscalculation, for his insights that really brought the story and its context to life. He gave us a pre-copy of his upcoming book, and it is fantastic: https://ve42.co/Miscalc
To Eric Hines for all his help with the technical details, fact-checking, and making sure we got the engineering right.
To Michael J. Vardaro for helping us uncover the details of the story and the resources he provided. 
To Brock Hedegaard for helping us dive deep into the Citicorp structural analysis. Learn the fundamentals of structural analysis on his brilliant channel, @StructuresProfH, and see here for his analysis of the citicorp center; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lE_DspFE2ZM
To Michele Barbato from UC Davis for his inputs on the load calculations.
https://faculty.engineering.ucdavis.edu/barbato/
Matt from @mvvvc  for talking us through his wind load analysis.
To Prof. Chris Letchford who helped us understand the impact of wind on Citicorp's structure. 
To DongHun Yeo from NIST for discussing his research about wind effects on buildings similar to citicorp: https://ve42.co/WindLoad
Finally, to Team Columbia —who built the epic TMD and ran wind tunnel experiments that made this story come alive.

Correction: 
0:12, we say that ingenuity is 680g which is its weight on Mars. On Earth however, it weighs around 1800g.

Clarifications:
- A Patreon supporter named Zeus pointed out that we were wrong about Perseverance's/Ingenuity's position on Mars. It is in the Northern Hemisphere and hence Mars would be getting closer to the Sun as it goes into winter.
- Ingenuity was on Mars for 1004 Earth days.

CORRECTION: We mistakenly used picture of the portrait artist Henry Tanworth Wells at 23:54. It should be a picture of CTR Wilson. Sorry! Thanks, @manicpixiedreambuoy, for pointing it out.

CORRECTION: The animation at 18:06 shows only the parallel polarization being transmitted, when in reality both parallel and perpendicular polarization light gets transmitted. Perpendicularly polarized light doesn't exhibit a Brester's angle so there's always both reflection and transmission when going from a high index of refraction material to a low index of refraction material.

Thank you to Peter Bevelacqua over at Antenna Theory for help filling in some missing details.

Sharp-eyed viewers might notice there doesn't seem to be a loop antenna in the flight simulation shots. It sadly wasn't included in the simulator's model of Earhart's Electra, but it features prominently in old photos.

This is a video I've long wanted to make, about what makes video look like video and, up until 10 years ago or so, not as appealing as film. I grew up with the two technologies (film and video) in parallel and to me they always seemed like two ways of achieving the same ends: recording and replaying moving images. But their histories are quite distinct. Film was always a way to capture moving images for later replaying. Video started out as a way to transfer images from one place to another instantaneously. This dates back to the first fax machine, mechanical TV, live broadcast tv and ultimately videotapes. This history focuses on the early decades of video and not the more recent switches to chip cameras and solid state storage. Maybe that's a story for another day.

Let's see how clearly I can explain this. We think of empty space as, well... empty, the epitome of nothingness. But as our understanding of physics has evolved we have realized that it's not truly empty. Space is filled with fields. There is a field for every subatomic particle. One for electrons, up quarks, down quarks, neutrinos and so on. In empty space these fields are basically zero, flat, nil. But it's impossible to make them perfectly zero so there are always some quantum fluctuations in the fields, even in a perfect vacuum. These are sometimes called virtual particles but they should really just be thought of as little disturbances in the field. Vacuum fluctuation play a role mediating the interactions of subatomic particles but they don't really have an impact on the large-scale structure of the universe, EXCEPT during inflation, right after the big bang when the universe increased in size 10^26 times. Due to this rapid expansion, those tiny fluctuations were blown up to the scale of the observable universe. And we know this by looking at the cosmic microwave background radiation where we can see slightly hotter and cooler parts of the early universe that correspond to density fluctuations. And it is these density fluctuations that allowed matter to clump together into large structures like the gigantic gas clouds that would go on to contain stars and planets. In case the video isn't clear, this is what I've been trying to say.

An enormous thanks to Prof. Steven Strogatz — this video would not have been possible without him. Much of the script-writing was inspired and informed by his wonderful book Sync, and his 2004 TED talk. He is a giant in this field, and has literally written the book on chaos, complexity, and synchronization. It was hard to find a paper in this field that Steven (or one of his students) didn't contribute to. His Podcast ""The Joy of X"" is wonderful — please listen and subscribe wherever you get your podcasts https://www.quantamagazine.org/tag/the-joy-of-x

This could make them ideal for space exploration. Check out http://kiwico.com/Veritasium50 for 50% off your first month of any subscription!

On Thursday February 18th, 2021 the NASA Perseverance Rover will land on Mars. It is a wonderful robot, made out of steel and wire — but will future robots look like Perseverance? There is an emerging field of  research on ""soft robots"", where the machines are flexible. These soft robots have many advantages over traditional robots — they're safer, lighter, more flexible and can change their shape and size.

NASA is investigating the use of soft robots for space missions. For future visits to Enceladus or Europa, a lander could cut a hole in the ice and then insert a compliant robot through the hole. This robot could then grow and change shape on the other side.

Special thanks to J.M.E.H van Bronswijk, author of 'House Dust Biology'. We exchanged emails to make sure I got my facts straight for this video. Below is an excerpt from her email to me, responding to my claims that start with a dash:

- Around half of airborne dust particles under 100um are skin scales
This is true for climates, regions and seasons where people live mostly indoors.
The 1 to 2 g of skin scales shed each 24 hours will end up in places where people are present (and rub their skin or have textile moving over the skin).
You can also look at it from a different angle: What else has the same size and could contribute? That will usually be pollen from outdoor sources, also depending on season, region and climate, as well as the ventilation regime of the building.
However, taken as the median value over a whole year, I consider your statement correct for regions with a temperate climate.

- 53% of dust particles vacuumed from a mattress were found to be skin scales
It depends a little on the type of mattress. For polyether mattresses the amount may even be larger.
For mattresses made of natural material it could be less since the mattress-material will also give off small particles.

- larger particles consist mostly of fibers, eg. cotton, paper, wool, synthetics
That's true .. including bread crumbs ..... 🙂

- skin scales seem to form a larger fraction of dust where we spend more time, e.g. in or near bed.
..... and on the couch used to view television or be active in gaming.
It has to do with the constant production of skin scales over the 24 hours.

- skin scales form a smaller fraction of dust if there are significant other sources, e.g. carpeting, dirt from outside etc.
Yes, everyting you walk on with your shoes or that recieves dirt from the outside with other means, will have a lessr percentage of human skin scales.
However, do not forget the skin scales of pets that will also be an active allergen for many people, and a food source for house dust mites.

Pavol Dobryakov turbulent simulations: https://paveldogreat.github.io/WebGL-Fluid-Simulation/

I got into turbulent flow via chaos. The transition to turbulence sometimes involves a period doubling. Turbulence itself is chaotic motion, it is unpredictable and sensitively dependent on initial conditions. What surprised me is all the ways turbulent flow is useful to us. It is diffusive, meaning it causes mixing. This is useful in jet engines or rocket nozzles (which Destin studies) and is important to achieve in microfluidic devices, which are so small that turbulent flow is actually difficult to achieve. Turbulent flow can energize a boundary layer, which is important to maintain flow attachment over a wing, maintaining lift and delaying stall. Similarly a turbulent boundary layer over a golf ball reduces pressure drag allowing golf balls to fly further. This is the reason for the dimples on golf balls. Flow transitioning to turbulence in the wake of a bluff body can create periodic vortex shedding. This beautiful phenomenon can be seen in the von Kàrmàn vortex street in clouds viewed from space. Turbulence is everywhere, in the air currents in a room, in your aorta, in the breaths you exhale, in oil pipelines and water pipes, in the flow over cars and ships and planes. Animals have evolved for it (like dead fish swimming up stream) and we have engineered our environment, our planes and golf balls for it. Laminar flow may be nice to look at (which is why we use it in decorative fountains) but turbulent flow does the real lifting.

His book, a major source for this video is 'Something Deeply Hidden: Quantum Worlds and The Emergence of Spacetime'

Code for solving the Schrödinger equation by Jonny Hyman available here: https://github.com/jonnyhyman/QuantumWaves

I learned quantum mechanics the traditional 'Copenhagen Interpretation' way. We can use the Schrödinger equation to solve for and evolve wave functions. Then we invoke wave-particle duality, in essence things we detect as particles can behave as waves when they aren't interacting with anything. But when there is a measurement, the wave function collapses leaving us with a definite particle detection. If we repeat the experiment many times, we find the statistics of these results mirror the amplitude of the wave function squared. Hence the Born rule came into being, saying the wave function should be interpreted statistically, that our universe at the most fundamental scale is probabilistic rather than deterministic. This did not sit well with scientists like Einstein and Schrödinger who believed there must be more going on, perhaps 'hidden variables'.

In the 1950's Hugh Everett proposed the Many Worlds interpretation of quantum mechanics. It is so logical in hindsight but with a bias towards the classical world, experiments and measurements to guide their thinking, it's understandable why the founders of quantum theory didn't come up with it. Rather than proposing different dynamics for measurement, Everett suggests that measurement is something that happens naturally in the course of quantum particles interacting with each other. The conclusion is inescapable. There is nothing special about measurement, it is just the observer becoming entangled with a wave function in a superposition. Since one observer can experience only their own branch, it appears as if the other possibilities have disappeared but in reality there is no reason why they could not still exist and just fail to interact with the other branches. This is caused by environmental decoherence.

What causes aging? According to Professor David Sinclair, it is a loss of information in our epigenome, the system of proteins like histones and chemical markers like methylation that turn on and off genes. Epigenetics allow different cell types to perform their specific functions - they are what differentiate a brain cell from a skin cell. Our DNA is constantly getting broken, by cosmic rays, UV radiation, free radicals, x-rays and regular cell division etc. When our cells repair that damage, the epigenome is not perfectly reset. And hence over time, noise accumulates in our epigenome. Our cells no longer perform their functions well. 

To counter this decline, we can activate the body's own defenses against aging by stressing the body. Eat less, eat less protein, engage in intense exercise, experience uncomfortable cold. When the body senses existential threats it triggers longevity genes, which attempt to maintain the body to ensure its survival until good times return. This may be the evolutionary legacy of early bacteria, which established these two modes of living (repair and protect vs grow and reproduce). Scientists are uncovering ways to mimic stresses on the body without the discomfort of fasting. Molecules like NMN also trigger sirtuins to monitor and repair the epigenome. This may slow aging.

Reversing aging requires an epigenetic reset, which may be possible using Yamanaka factors. These four factors can revert an adult cell into a pluripotent stem cell. Prof. Sinclair used three of the four factors to reverse aging in the retinal cells of old mice. He found they could see again after the treatment.

Among many other things this one features lots of pretty pictures :)

Conway and Guy's famous ""The book of numbers"" has a chapter dedicated to number walls. This is where I first learned about number walls. Sadly, Figure 3.24 on page 88 which describes the horse shoe rule is full of typos. Careful:
1. (formulae on right) Negate signs attached to  w_l/w  and  e_l/e ; 
2. (diagram on left) Leftward arrow missing from edge marked  w_2 ; 
3. The last row of arrows bears labels "" s_3 "" ... "" s_2 "" ... "" s_1 "" ,  which should instead read  "" s_1 "" ... "" s_2 "" ... "" s_3 "" .

Coding challenge
Create an online implementation of the number wall algorithm using determinants or, ideally, using the cross and horseshoe rules and do a couple of fun things with your program. Here are some possible ideas you could play with: 1. generate pictures of even number (or, more generally, mod p) windows of random integer sequences or of sequences grabbed from here https://oeis.org/ . 2. Explore the Pagoda sequence number wall, again mod various prime numbers. Here is the entry for this sequence in the on-line Encyclopaedia of integer sequences https://tinyurl.com/yc45cfvf  3.

Bug report
In the video I say that figuring out the factor rule is easy. This is only true for windows of 0s of even dimensions. Showing that the factor rule has a -1 on the right side for windows of odd dimensions is actually somewhat tricky. Details in the first article by Fred Lunnon listed above.

I have long wanted to make a video about chaos, ever since reading James Gleick's fantastic book, Chaos. I hope this video gives an idea of phase space - a picture of dynamical systems in which each point completely represents the state of the system. For a pendulum, phase space is only 2-dimensional and you can get orbits (in the case of an undamped pendulum) or an inward spiral (in the case of a pendulum with friction). For the Lorenz equations we need three dimensions to show the phase space. The attractor you find for these equations is said to be strange and chaotic because there is no loop, only infinite curves that never intersect. This explains why the motion is so unpredictable - two different initial conditions that are very close together can end up arbitrarily far apart.

On first glance it's surprising that origami -- a centuries old art of folding paper to achieve particular aesthetics -- is applicable to engineering. But upon closer consideration there are a lot of reasons methods developed for paper folding are also applicable to engineering: origami allows you to take a flat sheet of material and convert it to almost any shape only by folding. Plus for large flat structures, origami provides a way of shrinking dimensions while ensuring simply deployment - this is particularly useful for solar arrays in space applications. Furthermore, motions designed to take advantage of the flexibility of paper can also be used to form compliant mechanisms for engineering like the kaleidocycle. Since the principles of origami are scalable, mechanisms can also be dramatically miniaturized.

Below is a further discussion by Henry Reich that I think helps summarize why axes 1 and 3 are generally stable while axis 2 is not:

In general, you might imagine that because the object can rotate in a bunch of different directions, the components of energy and momentum could be free to change while keeping the total momentum constant.

However, in the case of axis 1, the kinetic energy is the highest possible for a given angular momentum, and in the case of axis 3, the kinetic energy is the lowest possible for a given angular momentum (which can be easily shown from conservation of energy and momentum equations, and is also fairly intuitive from the fact that kinetic energy is proportional to velocity squared, while momentum is proportional to velocity - so in the case of axis 1, the smaller masses will have to be spinning faster for a given momentum, and will thus have more energy, and vice versa for axis 3 where all the masses are spinning: the energy will be lowest). In fact, this is a strict inequality - if the energy is highest possible, there are no other possible combinations of momenta other than L2=L3=0, and vice versa for if the energy is the lowest possible.

Because of this, in the case of axis 1 the energy is so high that there simply aren't any other possible combinations of angular momentum components L1, L2 and L3 - the object would have to lose energy in order to spin differently. And in the case of axis 3, the energy is so low that there likewise is no way for the object to be rotating other than purely around axis 3 - it would have to gain energy. However, there's no such constraint for axis 2, since the energy is somewhere in between the min and max possible. This, together with the centrifugal effects, means that the components of momentum DO change.","2019-09-19 15:50:15","en",889,13667685,343318,"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/1VPfZ_XzisU/default.jpg",19804,"The Bizarre Behavior of Rotating Bodies","UCHnyfMqiRRG1u-2MsSQLbXA","27"

I had heard about Planet 9 for a long time but I wondered what sort of evidence could support the bold claim: a planet at the very limits of our ability to detect one, so far out that its period is over 60 times that of Neptune. The planet 9 hypothesis helps explain clustering of orbits of distant Kuiper belt objects. It also explains how some of these objects have highly inclined orbits - up to 90 degrees relative to the plane of the solar system. Some are orbiting in reverse. Plus their orbits are removed from the orbit of Neptune, the logical option for a body that could have ejected them out so far. The fact that the perihelion is so far out suggests another source of gravity was essential for their peculiar orbits.

For this video I partnered with Starbucks to celebrate their Nitro Cold Brew. Order one here: https://starbucks.app.link/derekmuller

Making liquid nitrogen is hard - in fact up until 150 years ago scientists doubted whether it was even possible to liquefy nitrogen. In 1823, At the royal institution in London, Michael Faraday first produced liquid chlorine, kind of accidentally by putting it under high pressure. He similarly liquefied ammonia.

Borrowing a mixture from Thilorier in France, a combination of dry ice, snow and ether, he reached a temperature of -110C. By 1845 he used this mixture plus a hand pump to pressurize gases to liquefy all the known gases except six, which included oxygen and nitrogen. These became known as the “permanent” gases.

A French Physicist Aimé compressed oxygen and nitrogen in tanks and then lowered them into the ocean over 1.6km deep, where the pressure got up to 200 atmospheres. Still the gases didn’t liquefy.

Only at the end of 1877 were the first droplets of liquid oxygen and liquid nitrogen produced, by Cailletet in France. He first tried oxygen by compressing it up to 300 atmospheres, cooled to -30C, but that wasn't even enough to liquefy oxygen. But when he suddenly released the pressure, the expanding gas cooled, he estimated to -200C and he saw a mist and then droplets slide down the walls of his vessel.

It's amazing how far we've come in that now I can purchase a helium-based cryocooler. It compresses and expands the gas to absorb heat from the tip of the cold finger and eject it into the surroundings at ambient temperature.","2019-08-16 17:06:32","en",823,8013705,109050,"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/dCXkaQa53QQ/default.jpg",5790,"Making Liquid Nitrogen From Scratch!","UCHnyfMqiRRG1u-2MsSQLbXA","27"

Temperatures plunge to -80C to -100C so two thirds of the craft's power is actually used to keep its electronics warm. Only one third is used for flying. The estimated flight time is 90 seconds.

The craft can't be driven remotely, it will have to fly autonomously, using its own sensor suite to determine how to fly. The round trip 20 minute delay with Earth means steering the craft from mission control would be impossible.

Full disclosure: I drive an #electric #car. I think electric cars are the future, not mainly because they're better for the environment (which they are if you drive the car for any reasonable length of time) but because they are just better cars. The have better torque and acceleration, better handling, they're more efficient, quieter, they don't smell, they're cheaper to run and best of all you never have to visit a gas station - this appeals to me. I never have to worry about being low on gas because every morning my car is charged and ready to go - just like my phone and laptop. And if you're worried about range, don't. Almost all trips can already be done in an electric car with modest battery pack. And fast chargers along the way make it possible to do longer road trips if necessary. You have to make rest stops anyway, just time them with the charging. And consider that battery tech is getting dramatically cheaper, smaller, lighter. All these reasons are why I see the #future of cars as electric.

I found this story fascinating because in a way a nuclear bomb crater is more like a meteorite impact site than an impact site itself. Consider: Barringer Crater was claimed to be a meteorite impact site but geologists dismissed it as a volcanic formation. It was only after studying nuclear bomb craters and the minerals found there that geologists concluded the energy and pressures that created Barringer Crater were too high to be from volcanic activity and therefore must have formed from a meteorite impact.

Aerogel’s extraordinary properties are due in large part to its structure. Aerogel is a solid but on the nanoscale it has a mesh or sponge-like structure. The struts of this structure are nanoscale, as are the pores at around 20nm across. This makes silica aerogel incredibly light (it was once the lightest solid but has now been superseded by graphene aerogel), transparent and adsorbent. 

An ice-cube sized piece of aerogel has an internal surface area roughly equal to half a football field. Aerogel is used in high end museum cases to regulate humidity. Plus it helps maintain the vacuum on the Mars Insight seismometers - it adsorbs moisture and other outgassed volatiles that come from the spacecraft itself. Proposed uses include as a physical insecticide by ‘drying out insects’ reducing the need for chemical and toxic pesticides.

All the signed shade balls have now been mailed out - thanks for your support!

Receiving a shade ball:

2. In about a month I will send out signed shade balls
3. I will cover all shipping costs but if things get really crazy I will prioritize existing Patreon supporters and higher tiers

My sense was that swimming in shade balls would be difficult but still doable. This was roughly true for the single layer of shade balls. The shade balls slide past each other so they act like a liquid, albeit a viscous one owing to their significant inertia. It's much more intense exercise and it's also annoying to be bombarded with shade balls on all sides of your body, particularly your head. With multi-layer shade balls (as exists on much of LA reservoir) things get significantly more difficult. The balls bunch together and when you try to move through them quickly, they become more rigid, providing significant resistance to motion. This has the benefit that you can lie on them and as long as they stay trapped under you, you can float on them. But a little bit of motion causes them to move around and you sink through quickly.

As the algorithm shifts, various YouTubers experience burnout (as what used to work no longer works) and right now click-through rate is the key metric. So clickable titles and thumbnails are the only way to get a lot of impressions and hence views - they are the only way to go viral. This leads me to wonder which audiences will become most prevalent on the site and if there will even be a place for educational content. In the long-term, hopefully YouTube is able to measure satisfaction through surveys and other metrics to ensure an optimal experience for everyone on the site.

The first time I heard about shade balls the claim was they reduce evaporation. But it turns out this isn't the reason they were introduced.

Huge thanks to LADWP for arranging this special tour for me. Next time let's put the GoPro on the submersible!

The balls are made of high density polyethylene (HDPE) which is less dense than water so they float on the surface of the reservoir even if they break apart. They are 10cm (4 inches) in diameter and contain about 210ml of water. So the main reason they are on the reservoir is to block sunlight from entering the water and triggering a chemical reaction that turns harmless bromide into carcinogenic bromate. This effect occurs with prolonged exposure to bromate so regulators insist that levels be kept below 10 microgram per liter on average over a 12 month period.

Special thanks to Assistant Professor Konstantin Batygin for discussing Ana's research and Planet 9 with me. More is coming on the Planet 9 front.

Ronak came up with a new design for the phoropter, the device used to determine eye-glass prescriptions. It's basically been unchanged for 200 years. Using a liquid lens, he miniaturized the device and wrote an algorithm to determine your prescription.

Ana used math and physics to search for hidden exoplanets. There are a number of reasons why the transit method and Kepler telescope may have missed them: they're too small, too inclined, or take too long to orbit and so were not seen. By considering which planetary systems have additional space for more planets, Ana came up with 560 locations where we may look again for planets in future.

Anjali developed an internet enabled device for measuring arsenic concentrations in drinking water. The device performs several chemical reactions to release the arsenic into a measurable state. It then reacts the arsenic with a test strip to produce a color output. This color is sampled by a camera and processed to determine the concentration of arsenic in the water sample. This has significant potential applications around the world helping reduce exposure to arsenic and potentially other contaminants.

This is an awesome paper on the topic by J.P. Luminet:
Image of a spherical black hole with thin accretion disk
Astronomy and Astrophysics, vol. 75, no. 1-2, May 1979, p. 228-235
https://ve42.co/luminet

Using my every day intuition I wondered: will we see the ""shadow"" of the black hole even if we're looking edge on at the accretion disk? The answer is yes because the black hole warps space-time, so even if we wouldn't normally be able to see the back of the accretion disk, we can in this case because its light is bent up and over the black hole. Similarly we can see light from the bottom of the back of the accretion disk because it's bent under the bottom of the black hole. Plus there are additional images from light that does a half turn around the black hole leading to the inner rings.

What about the black hole ""shadow"" itself? Well initially I thought it can't be an image of the event horizon because it's so much bigger (2.6 times bigger). But if you trace back the rays, you find that for every point in the shadow, there is a corresponding ray that traces back to the event horizon. So in fact from our one observing location, we see all sides of the event horizon simultaneously! In fact infinitely many of these images, accounting for the virtually infinite number of times a photon can orbit the black hole before falling in. The edge of the shadow is due to the photon sphere - the radius at which light goes around in closed orbits. If a light ray coming in at an oblique angle just skims the photon sphere and then travels on to our telescopes, that is the closest 'impact parameter' possible, and it occurs at sqrt(27)/2*r_s

Part of this video was sponsored by LastPass: http://bit.ly/2SmRQkk
Special thanks to Dr. Abe Davis for revisiting his research with me: http://abedavis.com

This video was based on research by Dr. Abe Davis and colleagues. I found out about this work years ago and was fascinated by the way he was able to capture vibration information in image-only video. I always imagined the motions of objects would be visible as when recording a tuning fork in slow motion - so deriving sound from high speed images seemed a feasible task. But the reality is much more difficult.

Sound vibrations only cause objects to wiggle by about a micrometer. This is much smaller than a pixel, so the algorithm must understand the characteristics of the image. A move in one direction should cause some pixels to lighten slightly, while others darken - and this behavior is correlated along the edges of the image. So noise can be reduced because it's random over the image and there are enough places to sample that you can get it to cancel out.

Something I'm wondering now is - would it be possible to capture sound in a single image? I'm thinking it would have to be an image of a large object or space because the wavelengths of typical sounds are quite long. Maybe a high frequency sound could be imaged in a suitable medium...

A grape is the right size and refractive index to trap microwaves inside it. When you place two (or two halves) close together the fields interact with each other creating a maximum of electromagnetic energy where they touch. This creates heating, sparks, and plasma, which is further fed with energy directly by the microwaves.

Human brains are complicated - the most complicated thing in the known universe, many people say. So far we understand little - just that certain regions of the brain appear to be involved in certain activities and certain disorders. In extreme cases this has led to the practice of removing sections of the brain, or using electrodes or optical fibers to control activation rates. What is unique about this approach is it offers a way to turn on and off specific brain regions without invasive surgery. It has promise because it combines existing technologies: micro-bubbles, ultrasound, synthetic viruses, and synthetic drugs to achieve this goal.

When I got offered the chance to fly in another #zeroG plane, I jumped at the chance. Do you know how hard it is when you are thrust into low-gravity, like the 37% of Earth's gravity of Mars, and you have to remember what you were going to say in a 30 second window as blood floods your head? It's pretty hard. It would be even harder to actually travel to Mars. It would take about 8 months in microgravity during which time your muscles and bones would weaken substantially, even if you exercise for hours a day like the astronauts on the space station. And your heart is a muscle too so it weakens as well. Before I contemplated these rates of muscle and bone loss, I thought the major challenge with a round trip journey to Mars would be the logistics of spacecraft and having enough fuel to get back. But with the weakening of the human body, it's an open question whether anyone would really want to come back.

When I started this project, I wasn't sure what caused dandruff and I also didn't think much science would go into making a shampoo like Head & Shoulders. So what I learned really surprised me:

There are hundreds of scientists working on this shampoo. They run crazy-sounding experiments like hanging hair near Tokyo highways to understand how real-world environments deposit dirt on hair. They use sophisticated scientific techniques like electron microscopes, nuclear magnetic resonance and gene sequencing to study dandruff on the molecular level.

In fact they sequenced the entire genome of Malassezia globosa in 2002, one year after the human genome project. Their findings are published in international refereed journals. What they have found is that the Malassezia fungi create free fatty acids as byproducts of their digestion, which for some people create irritation and lead to hyper-proliferation of skin cells, flaking, histamines, inflammatory cytokines, and blood proteins reaching the surface of the skin. These findings indicate the unhealthiness of dandruff scalp and suggest a possible remedy - controlling the metabolism of the Malassezia fungi. This is achieved using different active ingredients in different products and different parts of the world, including zinc pyrithione, selenium sulfide, and piroctone olamine. With the reduction of irritants, the scalp actually expresses different genes, producing a signature more similar to a non-dandruff baseline scalp.

Ultraviolet light causes damage to DNA, leads to cancer and photoaging: age spots and wrinkles. I was curious about this because UV is technically non-ionizing. A photon of UV doesn't have enough energy to strip an electron off atoms or molecules. However it does have enough energy to trigger photo-chemical reactions. For example, it causes pyrimidine dimers - the unauthorized covalent bonding of adjacent thymine or cytosine bases in our DNA. If these spots are not properly repaired, they may lead to mutations and cancer. Photoaging is typically the result of degradation of collagen and elastin fibers - scaffolding that supports the skin. This leads to wrinkles and saggy-looking skin.

Watch my new documentary, VITAMANIA: http://ve42.co/vita

I came across this story as I was making the film Vitamania. When you ask sellers of vitamins why you should take vitamin supplements even if you eat a healthy diet, they will say because our food doesn't contain all the nutrients it once did. This is supposedly due to soil depletion, cold storage, food ripening off the vine, and global transport of out-of-season foods. And to an extent this is true. Foods contain the greatest amount of nutrients if they are eaten soon after they are harvested. An unexpected source of nutrient decline is the increasing amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. It causes plants to grow faster and bulk up on carbs but at the expense of other nutrients, so in percentage terms the amount of nutrients are actually declining. For now this decline is modest so supplementing with vitamin pills is probably unnecessary for most people with a healthy diet but it may be a concern in future.

In summary, ultraviolet light interacts differently with matter for a number of reasons:
1. Some pigments selectively absorb UV so they may appear white in the visible but dark in the UV. The pigments usually dissipate the UV energy as heat, though the breaking of bonds can also occur.
2. Fluorescent molecules absorb UV light and re-radiate that energy as visible light. This makes them look dark in the UV but glowing under black light.
3. Ultraviolet light scatters more than visible light because the wavelength is shorter and Raleigh scattering is proportional to the reciprocal of wavelength to the power of four.

I learned a lot in making this video and the one on my second channel with Prof. Jon Arnou. I changed a lot of my preconceptions, specifically I thought:

1. That the Earth's magnetic field was a passive thing - it shouldn't need a continuous input of energy to maintain itself (that seemed reasonable to me because the magnetic field has been around for a long time and it seems mostly stable). But as it turns out, the Earth is a giant electromagnet, and so of course those currents dissipate their energy as they encounter resistance in the liquid metal through which they flow. So the energy to continuously create these currents comes from the kinetic energy of the liquid metal flows in the Earth's outer core.

2. If it's convection, I'm thinking hot things rising, cooler things falling. But apparently the main effect driving convection is the compositional differences at the boundary with the Earth's inner core. This is because of the differential freezing at the boundary. Things like iron freeze into the inner core, while elements like sulfur do not. Hence the pockets of lighter material which then rise outwards.

3. I didn't get why the fluid motion was necessary for the generation of the magnetic field. I mean if it's a conducting liquid, it can conduct currents whether it moves or not. But the key is that the liquid metal can 'trap' magnetic fields. I imagine this like how iron channels magnetic fields. Then once these fields are channeled, they can be pulled and stretched, making more magnetic field.

4. Fluids operate very differently in rotating frames of reference. This is something I didn't intuitively grasp. But, as fluids move from the inner core outwards, those particles are moving much more slowly in the direction of rotation than the matter that has been there for a long time, which means the convection currents get deflected and form helices.

I hope I've articulated everything clearly in this video. If not, I'll clarify in comments. Thanks to everyone who appears in this video and thanks to everyone who watches this video!

Veritasium is of course a combination of the latin 'veritas' meaning truth, and the common element ending 'ium'. I guess this is my version of the 'draw my life' craze that rolled through YouTube many years ago. Except I wanted to tell my story with the actual moments, the photons, the stored magnetic states. There's something about that which is so important to me (because I think the alternative involves fooling yourself) which is why I'm so fascinated by film and video.

One of my inspirations for the name Veritasium came from the end of the poem Ode on a Grecian Urn by John Keats, in which he writes:
 ""Beauty is truth, truth beauty,—that is all
                Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know.""

A few years ago I made a documentary about uranium, radioactivity and radiation. I always thought of the characters in our story as the scientists and maybe the uranium nucleus itself. It was only through making the documentary that I realized the real hero of the story is the neutron. Without a neutral nuclear particle, it would be virtually impossible to release the energy from the nucleus. But with it, and the idea of a chain reaction, nuclear energy went from science fiction to reality. That is something I had not grasped as clearly before and it motivated me to make this video.

I'm not sure how alarmed to be about artificial intelligence. Personally I think it's really hard to predict when we'll create a machine that essentially has consciousness. That's because we don't know what consciousness is, how it works, what's required to create it etc. So It might be technologically around the corner or a hundred years away.

What I do think is more predictable is the development of autonomous weapons that use AI to be the most effective killing machines of all time. That is scary. As outline by people like Musk and Hawking, this threat is clear and present so we should address it. I would like to see us agree as a species not to develop these sorts of weapons because if any one state does develop them, they would be very hard to stop.","2018-04-02 14:00:01","en",407,887514,38031,"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/XAgXwUwQoPA/default.jpg",3789,"The Threat of AI Weapons","UCHnyfMqiRRG1u-2MsSQLbXA","27"

Some things we know make mosquitoes more attracted to you:
Exercising, higher metabolism, higher body temperature, more body odor, being pregnant, type O blood, infrequent bathing, lactic acid, ammonia, acetone.

There are a number of folk remedies people believe protect them from mosquito bites like drinking alcohol, eating garlic, or taking vitamin B. These do not appear to provide any benefit in lab studies and in fact drinking alcohol is associated with increased mosquito activity because it causes blood vessels near the surface of the skin to dilate.

And apparently some of your attractiveness to mosquitos is simply genetic. This may be mediated through your immune system, which is what a lot of the genes identified were associated with.

This video is sponsored by Mercedes-Benz, who invited me to come to Stuttgart to see their latest cars, crash test facilities and experience the innovations they are working on.

Physics is something that is directly applicable to car safety. Cars go fast, but they also sometimes collide with obstacles, which brings them to a sudden stop, subjecting the car and occupants to very high accelerations, which can cause injury or death. So the major idea to improve car safety is to reduce these accelerations and there are a number of ways to do this:

Passive safety:

Seat belts: keep passengers in the vehicle, preventing them from continuing with constant velocity, flying through the windshield and suffering a worse deceleration when they make contact with the road.

Crumple zones: increase the distance over which deceleration occurs, thereby reducing peak magnitude of deceleration.

Air bags: increase the distance over which the head decelerates, again reducing peak magnitude of deceleration of the head.

Active Safety:
Anti-lock braking system: rather than 'locking' the wheels as can happen if you slam on the brakes with a traditional braking system leading to the tires skidding across the road, ABS attempts to control the amount of braking so that the tires always roll with static friction in contact with the road. This increases the backward frictional force that can be applied to the tires, again increasing the distance over which deceleration occurs, and it gives the driver an opportunity to steer to avoid the collision (hence why it's referred to as an active safety system).

Every day in an adult human roughly 50-70 billion of your cells die. They may be damaged, stressed, or just plain old - this is normal, in fact it’s called programmed cell death.

To make up for that loss, right now, inside your body, billions of cells are dividing, creating new cells.

And cell division, also called mitosis, requires an army of tiny molecular machines.DNA is a good place to start - the double helix molecule that we always talk about.

This is a scientifically accurate depiction of DNA. If you unwind the two strands you can see that each has a sugar phosphate backbone connected to the sequence of nucleic acid base pairs, known by the letters A,T,G, and C.

Now the strands run in opposite directions, which is important when you go to copy DNA. Copying DNA is one of the first steps in cell division. Here the two strands of DNA are being unwound and separated by the tiny blue molecular machine called helicase.
It literally spins as fast as a jet engine! The strand of DNA on the right has its complimentary strand assembled continuously but the other strand is more complicated because it runs in the opposite direction.
So it must be looped out with its compliment strand assembled in reverse, section by section. At the end of this process you have two identical DNA molecules, each one a few centimeters long but just a couple nanometers wide.

To prevent the DNA from becoming a tangled mess, it is wrapped around proteins called a histones, forming a nucleosome.
These nucleosomes are bundled together into a fiber known as chromatin, which is further looped and coiled to form a chromosome, one of the largest molecular structures in your body.
You can actually see chromosomes under a microscope in dividing cells - only then do they take on their characteristic shape.

The process of dividing the cell takes around an hour in mammals. This footage is from a time lapse. You can see how the chromosomes line up on the equator of the cell. When everything is right they are pulled apart into the two new daughter cells, each one containing an identical copy of DNA.
As simple as it looks, this process is incredibly complicated and requires even more fascinating molecular machines to accomplish it. Let’s look at a single chromosome. One chromosome consists of two sausage-shaped chromatids - containing the identical copies of DNA made earlier. Each chromatid is attached to microtubule fibers, which guide and help align them in the correct position. The microtubules are connected to the chromatid at the kinetochore, here colored red.
The kinetochore consists of hundreds of proteins working together to achieve multiple objectives - it’s one of the most sophisticated molecular mechanisms inside your body. The kinetochore is central to the successful separation of the chromatids. It creates a dynamic connection between the chromosome and the microtubules. For a reason no one’s yet been able to figure out, the microtubules are constantly being built at one end and deconstructed at the other.
While the chromosome is still getting ready, the kinetochore sends out a chemical stop signal to the rest of the cell, shown here by the red molecules, basically saying this chromosome is not yet ready to divide
The kinetochore also mechanically senses tension. When the tension is just right and the position and attachment are correct all the proteins get ready, shown here by turning green.
At this point the stop signal broadcasting system is not switched off. Instead it is literally carried away from the kinetochore down the microtubules by a dynein motor. This is really what it looks like. It has long ‘legs’ so it can avoid obstacles and step over the kinesins, molecular motors walking the other direction.

Virgo Helps Localize Gravitational-Wave Signals
Sky localizations of gravitational-wave signals detected by LIGO beginning in 2015 (GW150914, LVT151012, GW151226, GW170104), and, more recently, by the LIGO-Virgo network (GW170814, GW170817). After Virgo came online in August 2017, scientists were better able to localize the gravitational-wave signals. The background is an optical image of the Milky Way. The localizations of GW150914, LVT151012, and GW170104 wrap around the celestial sphere, so the sky map is shown with a translucent dome.

22/7 was found by Archimedes in the second century as part of the strict inequality 223/71 less than pi less than 22/7 and 377/120 was mentioned by Ptolemy in the 3rd century.

Want to make this at home? https://youtu.be/BppcHF2EdAY

My friend Blake from InnoVinci emailed me with a cool idea for a video and footage of levitating balls in water streams. Initially it was tough to explain the physics of what was going on. The standard Bernoulli effect relies on the object being completely immersed in the upward-flowing fluid. But in this case the water seems to form a single stream around the object and it's deflected away and down from the stream. By Newton's third law, the force on the water by the ball is equal and opposite to the force of the water back on the ball, pushing it up into the stream. There is a stable equilibrium position because if the ball moves into the stream, it ""cuts off"" the water going over the ball so it drifts out. If it drifts out too far, then lots of water passes over the ball, pushing it back into the stream.

I first saw a Schlieren imaging setup around ten years ago in Melbourne. I was immediately fascinated by the way I could see the warm air coming off my hand. I hadn't expected the currents to be moving that fast or to be so visible. This was a tricky setup to get right because alignment is very important and here I'm just working with what I had lying around the house mostly (plus the mirror). For the best Schlieren photography, making sure the mirror is stable is essential. I want to improve my setup so the mirror doesn't wobble back and forth too much creating the pulsing light and dark sections of this video.

The relationship between index of refraction of air and temperature, pressure, humidity and wavelength is complicated. This website will calculate it for you: http://emtoolbox.nist.gov/Wavelength/Ciddor.asp

The intensity of sunlight on Earth is about 1300 Watts per square meter. When you focus the sun's rays using a magnifying glass (or in this case sphere of water) you can increase the intensity roughly ten thousand fold. This increases the temperature of wood to its autoignition point starting the reaction with oxygen in the atmosphere. By protecting the hot embers and adding more energy and fuel, you can get these hot coals to start a roaring fire.

Before visiting NIST in Washington DC I had no idea machines like this existed. Surely there's an accurate way to measure forces without creating such a huge known force?! Nope. This appears to be the best way, with a stack of 20 x 50,000 lb masses creating a maximum force of 4.45 MN or 1,000,000 pounds of force. I also wouldn't have thought about all the corrections that need applying - for example buoyancy subtracts about 125 pounds from the weight of the stack. Plus the local gravitational field strength must be taken into account. And, the gravitational field varies below grade. All of this must be taken into account in order to limit uncertainty to just five parts per million (.0005%)

Back in 1875 The US signed the Metre Convention, which basically committed the country to use the metric system. In return, French scientists sent two platinum-iridium cylinders that weigh 1kg to the US in 1889 (known by their designations K4 and K20 from a set of 40 identical objects that were produced and sent around the world). So even though everything you see and buy in the US is usually reported in pounds, all weights are traceable back to the K20 kilogram (by applying a conversion factor to get to pounds).

When I was in DC a few weeks ago, I visited the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) and got up close with K20, which is still kept there and used to calibrate all mass standards in this country. I thought it was pretty cool.

The zero-g plane allows for a lot of experiments to be conducted without the expense of getting equipment into orbit. Apparently 80% of microgravity research can be performed in a zero-gravity plane, which is much cheaper than going to space. The flame from the lighter seemed much lazier in zero-g because without weight there is no buoyant force and therefore no convection. This makes the process of combustion more challenging because it's difficult for oxygen to reach the fuel.

Lehrbuch der Chemie by Jöns Jakob Berzelius

Script:
As an Australian-Canadian the Fahrenheit temperature scale always seemsed a bit arbitrary. I mean why does water freeze at 32 degrees? And what exactly does zero represent?

According to many sources the Fahrenheit scale was defined by setting zero degrees equal to the temperature of an ice, salt, and water mixture and 100 degrees being roughly equal to human body temperature. But that isn’t true.

The real story is much more interesting, and scientific...

August 14th 1701 was almost certainly the worst day in the life of fifteen year-old Daniel Gabriel Fahrenheit. On that day both of his parents died suddenly from mushroom poisoning. He was sent from Poland, where he lived, to Amsterdam to become an apprentice bookkeeper.

But Fahrenheit couldn’t stand his apprenticeship and ran away so many times his employers put out a warrant for his arrest. Traveling from city to city around Europe, he became fascinated with scientific instruments and in particular thermometers.

In 1708, possibly seeking help with the warrant, Fahrenheit met with the mayor of Copenhagen, who happened to be the famous astronomer Ole Romer.

Romer is known for observing the eclipses of Jupiter’s moons and realizing that variations in the timing of those eclipses was caused by the time it took light to reach Earth. In other words, he found a way to accurately measure the finite speed of light.

But more pertinent to this story, in 1702 Romer was housebound after breaking his leg. To pass the time he devised a new temperature scale with the freezing point of water at 7.5 degrees and body temperature at 22.5 degrees.

This might seem odd until you consider that Romer wanted the boiling point of water to be 60 degrees (as an astronomer, he had experience dividing things by 60). If you take this scale, divide it in half, in half again, and in half once more, you find the freezing point of water 1/8th up the scale, and human body temperature 3/8th up the scale.

So at their meeting in 1708, Fahrenheit learned of Romer’s temperature scale and adopted it as his own, adjusting it slightly because he found it “inconvenient and inelegant on account of the fractional numbers”. So he scaled them up to 8 and 24.

That is the original Fahrenheit scale. He produced thermometers for some time using this scale.

But then, at some later time Fahrenheit multiplied all numbers on his scale by four, setting freezing point to the now familiar 32 and body temperature to 96. It’s unclear exactly why he did this. He may just have wanted finer precision in his measurements but I think there was a better reason.

You see, Fahrenheit was an excellent instrument maker. His thermometers agreed with each other precisely, at a time when that was unheard of. He pioneered the use of mercury as a measuring liquid, which has the benefit of a much higher boiling point than the alcohol used in most other thermometers at the time. For these accomplishments, he was inducted into the British Royal Society.

And we know he read the works of Newton, Boyle, and Hooke, in which he would have come across the idea that a one degree increase in temperature should correspond to a specific fractional increase in the volume of the measuring liquid.

And today a one degree Fahrenheit increase in temperature increases the volume of mercury by exactly one part in 10,000. Is this just a coincidence? We’ll probably never know for sure because as an instrument maker Fahrenheit was secretive about his methods. But I think the data strongly suggests this was the case.

So what exactly did zero represent on the scales of Fahrenheit and Romer? By many accounts it’s the temperature of a salt, ice and water mixture. But there are different descriptions of these mixtures and none of them actually produces the temperature they’re supposed to. More likely I think they picked the coldest temperature in winter, set that as zero and later used ice and brine to calibrate new thermometers. Now his scale is only used regularly in the Cayman Islands, Bahamas, Belize, oh and the United States of America.","2016-11-28 15:32:12","en",324,5534279,145931,"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/LgrXd0NM2y8/default.jpg",12481,"What the Fahrenheit?!","UCHnyfMqiRRG1u-2MsSQLbXA","27"

*So technically the single nucleotide swap (C instead of T) is not actually in a gene per se but in an intergenic region on chromosome 2. It's also not clear exactly how this affects physiology or causes the sun sneeze but there is correlative evidence that every copy of this single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) is associated with a 1.3x increase in likelihood of having the photic sneeze reflex.

I have wanted to make a video about sun-sneezing for a long time. It is something I've experienced my whole life. When I go from a dark room indoors into full sunlight I invariably sneeze. I thought everyone did it. So my original question was why do people sneeze when they see bright light? That led me to consider what possible evolutionary advantages there could be to sneezing in sunlight. The obvious advantage to me is that sunlight kills pathogens of which there may be many in your snot or mucus. So sneezing in sunshine is a much better idea than sneezing inside a dark, damp cave where you may be living.

A few notes on the puzzle:
1. A half-full container of honey does pretty well in reproducing the behaviour of the mystery cylinder. I wonder if the motion is a little smoother or more periodic with the ping-pong balls because they move as organized objects - also the delays between motion seemed to be longer with them than without ping pong balls.

2. For the average speed track problem, every time I said velocity I meant speed. Sorry to the pedants out there who are perhaps looking for some trick answer due to displacement being zero when you run around a track.

3. Although a lot of people identified it was something about a train's wheels that move backwards, fewer identified that specifically it was the part of the flange below the rail. Some simply said the bottom half of the wheel.

4. The bicycle question is perhaps the most complex of these riddles. If you tried it with a bike you likely found that it went backwards. But what happens if you sit on the bike and only push backwards on the bottom pedal. The answer might surprise you so give it a shot!","2017-04-18 13:30:00","en",531,4106554,91798,"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/72DCj3BztG4/default.jpg",5544,"4 Revolutionary Riddles Resolved!","UCHnyfMqiRRG1u-2MsSQLbXA","27"

I didn't say it explicitly in the video, but in my view the Bayesian trap is interpreting events that happen repeatedly as events that happen inevitably. They may be inevitable OR they may simply be the outcome of a series of steps, which likely depend on our behaviour. Yet our expectation of a certain outcome often leads us to behave just as we always have which only ensures that outcome. To escape the Bayesian trap, we must be willing to experiment.

The Theory That Would Not Die: How Bayes’ Rule Cracked the Enigma Code, Hunted Down Russian Submarines, and Emerged Triumphant from Two Centuries of Controversy, by Sharon Bertsch McGrayne

Bayes' theorem or rule (there are many different versions of the same concept) has fascinated me for a long time due to its uses both in mathematics and statistics, and to solve real world problems. Bayesian inference has been used to crack the Enigma Code and to filter spam email. Bayes has also been used to locate the wreckage from plane crashes deep beneath the sea.

The standard theory of quantum mechanics leaves a bit to be desired. As Richard Feynman put it, ""I think I can safely say that no one understands quantum mechanics."" This is because observations of experiments have led us to a theory that contradicts common sense. The wave function contains all the information that is knowable about a particle, yet it can only be used to calculate probabilities of where a particle will likely turn up. It can't give us an actual account of where the particle went or where it will be at some later time.

Some have suggested that this theory is incomplete. Maybe something is going on beneath the radar of standard quantum theory and somehow producing the appearance of randomness and uncertainty without actually being random or uncertain. Theories of this sort are called hidden variable theories because they propose entities that aren't observable. One such theory is pilot wave theory, first proposed by de Broglie, but later developed by Bohm. The idea here is that a particle oscillates, creating a wave. It then interacts with the wave and this complex interaction determines its motion.

Experiments using silicone oil droplets on a vibrating bath provide a remarkable physical realization of pilot wave theories. They give us a physical picture of what the quantum world might look like if this is what's going on - and this theory is still deterministic. The particle is never in two places at once and there is no randomness.

For the record Destin and I repeated the experiment 3-4 times each in each hemisphere and got the same results every time.

The idea that water going down a drain or flushed down a toilet swirls in opposite directions in the Northern and Southern Hemispheres has a long history. But few have ever done the experiment. Destin from Smarter Every Day and I performed identical experiments in the Northern and Southern hemispheres. What we found is the direction of water swirl in a toilet, sink, or bathtub is determined by other sources of angular momentum. However if the body of water is big enough, e.g. a kiddy pool, and left still for long enough (at least 24 hours), then the Coriolis effect is observable with water swirling counterclockwise in the Northern hemisphere and clockwise in the Southern hemisphere.

Gordon McGladdery did all of the sound design for the video. We used two songs from other artists (licensed of course). Derek split the first one up so it fades from video to video, and Gordon split the instruments up on the second one. There are violins on one video and percussion on the other for example. It's really neat.

The neat earth animation at the beginning and the synchronizing timer was made by http://eisenfeuer.com/. He also made still images of the earth from the top and the bottom.

A lot of videos have covered the general overview of the discovery of gravitational waves, what they are, the history of the search, when they were found but I wanted to delve into the absurd science that made the detection possible.

When scientists want one megawatt of laser power, it's not just for fun (though I'm sure it's that too), it's because the fluctuations in the number of photons is proportional to their square root, making more powerful beams less noisy (as a fraction of their total). The smoothest mirrors were created not for aesthetic joy but because when you're trying to measure wiggles that are a fraction the width of a proton, a rough mirror surface simply won't do.

Virtual particles are a way of talking about fields and their interactions as though particles are doing all the work. This is why there is some controversy around using the term 'virtual particles'. Some people think the term is useful, especially since in calculating with Feynman diagrams you draw all the particle interactions that are possible (and then do the calculations to get the right answer). While others feel this terminology is misleading because virtual particles don't behave like real particles and can't be observed.","2016-09-08 14:00:02","en",523,2852997,72585,"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/g20JZ2HNZaw/default.jpg",3525,"The Best and Worst Prediction in Science","UCHnyfMqiRRG1u-2MsSQLbXA","27"

Come take a walk with me around Longyearbyen, the largest town on the Norwegian islands of Svalbard.

Parts of it look familiar, but make no mistake, this place is different.

At 78 degrees North, it lies just 800 miles or 1300 kilometres from the North Pole. And with over 2,000 permanent inhabitants it is the Northernmost real town on Earth.

There are only 50km of road, including the small streets between houses, so people get around the island mainly on snowmobile.

In fact there are more registered snowmobiles than residents.

Anyone leaving town is required to travel with a gun and someone who knows how to use it because the islands are also home to polar bears.

The average daytime high is below freezing for all but four months of the year, and from the end of October to mid-February the sun doesn’t rise at all. This is the long polar night.

Living here is tough. This past December an avalanche in town destroyed 10 homes, which used to be here, killing two people.

So how did this cold, remote, ice-covered archipelago come to be inhabited?

The hills around town are rich in coal deposits that have been mined for over 100 years.

The coal was transported to the port via a series of aerial tramways some of which remain today, though they are no longer operational.

Coal is a reminder that Svalbard was not always an Arctic ice world. 360 million years ago it was actually in the tropics North of the equator. A swampy area, it was covered with the precursors to modern ferns, which were much larger than they are today, reaching 10-30 metres in height.

This vegetation was then covered in mud and sand and submerged under the sea. Over time it turned into the coal deposits that in the 20th century brought miners from Norway, Russia, and the US.

Most of the coal mines have now closed and the economy is gradually shifting towards tourism, education and research.

Tourists take trips on snowmobiles and dog sleds.

There is a university centre in Svalbard, which offers semester courses in biology, physics and geology.

And up on the side of a mountain is the Svalbard Global seed vault… but that’s a story for another time.

The locals tell me that interest in the region from different nations is increasing.

As the globe warms and Arctic ice shrinks, trade routes are opening up across the North. And Svalbard is strategically placed between North America, Asia and Europe.

One day in the future Svalbard may no longer be as cold or remote as it once was.

But for now it is a reminder of how through our ingenuity people can live in the most inhospitable of places.

We each repeated the experiment 3 times, and got the same results every time. For those of you who might be skeptical, great! A right circular prismatic kiddie pool is only $10 and you can do the experiment for yourself at your latitude. There's really no reason you shouldn't do it for yourself.

Gordon McGladdery did all of the sound design for the video. We used two songs from other artists (licensed of course). Derek split the first one up so it fades from video to video, and Gordon split the instruments up on the second one. There are violins on one video and percussion on the other for example. It's really neat.

The neat earth animation at the beginning and the synchronizing timer was made by http://eisenfeuer.com/. He also made still images of the earth from the top and the bottom.

Make sure to watch part 1 of this video before you watch part 2: https://youtu.be/rAHcZGjKVvg

In this second part we look at higher-dimensional counterparts of the basic 3D cube shadow theorem of part 1. We'll see how it is used to find the truly wonderful maximal area and volume 2D and 3D shadows of higher-dimensional cubes. Featuring close-to-circular shadows of hypercubes, the amazing rhombic dodecahedron, the even more amazing rhombic triacontahedron, Wolfram Alpha's logo and much more. 

The page with my first year hovering-cube assignment lives here: http://www.qedcat.com/misc/cube_assignment.pdf

Pretty much everything that is known about the shadow theorem is written up in the following two papers by mathematician Peter McMullen:
1. Volumes of Projections of unit Cubes, Peter McMullen, Bull London Math. Soc. (1984) 16: 278-280.
2. Volumes of Complementary Projections of Convex Polytopes, Mh. Math. 104, 265-272 (1987)

Just for the sake of completeness here is a 3d .stl file of the maximal 3d shadow of a 5D hypercube: http://www.qedcat.com/misc/5d.stl  (one reference that talks about it a little bit is Coxeter's classic textbook, Regular polytopes, p. 256, last paragraph).

As usual thank you very much to Marty Ross and Danil Dimitriev for their help with this video and Michael Franklin for his help with recording this video..

I used  Richard Koch's program Hypersolids for the animation of the spinning 4D hypercube: http://pages.uoregon.edu/koch/hypersolids/hypersolids.html

Most of the other animations I programmed in Mathematica. The stills featuring the rhombic triacontahedron were done in Rhino3d, one of my weapons of choice when it comes to preparing files for 3d printing geometrical objects.

What is NOT random? http://bit.ly/NOTrandoVe
First, I know this video is not easy to understand. Thank you for taking the time to attempt to understand it. I've been working on this for over six months over which time my understanding has improved. Quantum entanglement and spooky action at a distance are still debated by professors of quantum physics (I know because I discussed this topic with two of them).

Does hidden information (called hidden variables by physicists) exist? If it does, the experiment violating Bell inequalities indicates that hidden variables must update faster than light - they would be considered 'non-local'. On the other hand if you don't consider the spins before you make the measurement then you could simply say hidden variables don't exist and whenever you measure spins in the same direction you always get opposite results, which makes sense since angular momentum must be conserved in the universe.

Everyone agrees that quantum entanglement does not allow information to be transmitted faster that light. There is no action either detector operator could take to signal the other one - regardless of the choice of measurement direction, the measured spins are random with 50/50 probability of up/down.

Psychological literature shows that we are more sensitive to small losses and than small gains, with most people valuing a loss around 1.5-2.5 times as much as a gain. This means that we often turn down reasonable opportunities for fear of the loss. However over the course of our lives we will be exposed to many risks and opportunities and this invariably means that taking every small reasonable bet will leave us better off than saying no to all of them.

NOTE: The video is not saying to accept every bet, only those with reasonable odds (preferably in your favour), and those which if you lose would not cause significant financial or other damage. In those cases it is wise to be loss averse!

I'm filming a documentary for TV about how Uranium and radioactivity have shaped the modern world. It will be broadcast in mid-2015, details to come. The filming took me to the most radioactive places on Earth (and some places, which surprisingly aren't as radioactive as you'd think). Chernobyl and Fukushima were incredible to see as they present post-apocalyptic landscapes. I also visited nuclear power plants, research reactors, Marie Curie's institute, Einstein's apartment, nuclear medicine areas of hospitals, uranium mines, nuclear bomb sites, and interviewed numerous experts.

Notes about measuring radiation:
Sieverts are a measure of 'effective dose' - that means they measure the biological impact of the energy transferred to tissues from radiation.

Obviously I owe a debt to the fantastic chart made by xkcd, which inspired my visual approach to this video.
https://xkcd.com/radiation/

DOSES MAY VARY
The level of radiation varies widely around the world depending mainly on altitude and geology (excluding nuclear accidents).

Estimates of particular doses also vary. All numbers reported in this video should be taken as order of magnitude only.

The most contentious claim may be that smokers receive the highest dose of ionizing radiation. This is not a whole body dose, but a dose to the lungs as specified in the video. References are here:

These ideas have been percolating since I wrote my PhD in physics education: https://ve42.co/phd
I have also discussed this topic with CGP Grey, whose view of the future of education differs significantly from mine: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7vsCAM17O-M

I think it is instructive that each new technology has appeared to be so transformative. You can imagine, for example, that motion pictures must have seemed like a revolutionary learning technology. After all they did revolutionize entertainment, yet failed to make significant inroads into the classroom. TV and video seem like a cheaper, scaled back film, but they too failed to live up to expectations. Now there is a glut of information and video on the internet so should we expect it to revolutionize education?

My view is that it won't, for two reasons: 1. Technology is not inherently superior, animations over static graphics, videoed presentations over live lectures etc. and 2. Learning is inherently a social activity, motivated and encouraged by interactions with others.

The most common misconception about the pyramids is that they were built by slaves. Recent archeological evidence suggests they were instead constructed by paid workers. Some may have performed this work as a form of tax payment for several months of the year. Skilled engineers would have planned and orchestrated the building. An estimated 10,000-20,000 people would have been working on a pyramid at any one point in time. They were well fed and provided with shelter near the pyramids. Plus their burial sites close by indicate they were respected and were not slaves.

Much of the limestone was quarried from the Giza plateau itself, meaning the stones did not need to be transported far. The granite casing of Menkaure's pyramid, on the other hand, was transported from Aswan, around 600 miles, or 1000 km up the Nile.

When a female embryo is four days old it consists of just 100 cells. At this point the x-chromosome from Mom and the one from Dad are both active. But in order for proper development to occur, one of the x chromosomes must be switched off.

Through a tiny molecular battle within each cell, one of the x-chromosomes wins and remains active while the loser is deactivated.

This is done by wrapping the DNA tighter around proteins, modifying histone tails, and DNA methylation - molecular markers to indicate this DNA should not be read.

What's surprising is that it's pretty random which x chromosome wins - sometimes it's Mom's and sometimes it's Dad's. So when a female is just 100 cells big, her cells have a mix of active x-chromosomes, some from Mom and some from Dad.","2014-06-04 15:00:07","en-GB",317,9847328,264831,"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/BD6h-wDj7bw/default.jpg",15626,"Why Women Are Stripey","UCHnyfMqiRRG1u-2MsSQLbXA","27"

The expanding universe is a complicated place. During inflation the universe expanded faster than light, but that's something that actually happens all the time, it's happening right now. This doesn't violate Einstein's theory of relativity since nothing is moving through space faster than light, it's just that space itself is expanding such that far away objects are receding rapidly from each other. Common sense would dictate that objects moving away from us faster than light should be invisible, but they aren't. This is because light can travel from regions of space which are superluminal relative to us into regions that are subluminal. So our observable universe is bigger than our Hubble sphere - it's limited by the particle horizon, the distance light could travel to us since the beginning of time as we know it.","2014-05-27 15:00:07","en-GB",346,7545940,175887,"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/XBr4GkRnY04/default.jpg",18318,"Misconceptions About the Universe","UCHnyfMqiRRG1u-2MsSQLbXA","27"

There are some other proofs of Ptolemy's theorem/inequality  based on scaling and aligning suitable triangles. However, none of them is as slick, beautiful and powerful as Rainer's new proof. In particular, check out the animated scaling proof on the wiki page for Ptolemy's theorem (and this https://youtu.be/ZK08Z5A9xH4) and check out the scaling proof by Claudi Asina and Roger Nelson: Proof Without Words: Ptolemy’s Inequality in Mathematics Magazine 87, (2014), p. 291. https://www.jstor.org/stable/10.4169/math.mag.87.4.291
Rainer was inspired by a classic scaling based proof of Pythagoras theorem that I presented here https://youtu.be/p-0SOWbzUYI?si=GeGzZ0R_Dj1AsXqR&t=371

Ptolemy's theorem made a guest appearance in the the previous Mathologer video on the golden ratio: https://youtu.be/cCXRUHUgvLI

Here is a nice trick to make Ptolemy counterparts of Pythagorean triples. Take any two sets of Pythagorean triples:
5² = 3² + 4², 13² = 12² + 5², and combine them like this:
65² = 13² × 5²= 13²(4² + 3²) = 52² + 39²= 5²(12² + 5²) = 60² + 25².
Now combining the two right angled triangles 52-39-65 and 25-60-65 along the common diagonal in any of four different ways gives a convex quadrilateral with all sides integers. Note that you automatically get 5 integer lengths and then Ptolemy's theorem guarantees that the remaining side is a fraction. Scaling up everything by the denominator of that fraction gives one of the special integer-everywhere quadrilaterals. See also Brahmagupta quadrilaterals.

Here is a nice application of Ptolemy's theorem to a International Maths Olympiad problem https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NHjtHOE1lks

In a cyclic quadrilateral the ratio of the diagonals equals the ratio of the sums of products of the sides that share the diagonals' end points: https://www.geogebra.org/m/XQr5jJQg This extension of Ptolemy's theorem is part of the thumbnail for this video.

Most amazing thing about trees: http://bit.ly/TFilQ8

We often imagine that unregulated competition produces optimal outcomes, behaviours, efficiencies, but trees and baggage carousels are two examples where the stable solution is worse for everyone than another strategy. This I find surprising and interesting - that evolution doesn't come to the best solution, it comes to the most stable one.

The Forest of Friendship was a concept I first came across in Richard Dawkin's book ""The Greatest Show on Earth."" One point I'd like to clarify is that being taller comes with a cost - having a longer trunk requires costly expenditure of energy. However, in a forest of uniformly short trees, being a little taller conveys an advantage. That is until all the other trees catch up, at which time the extra height no longer provides a benefit. So over time as the whole forest rises up the conditions are getting worse for each tree, but they are powerless to stop the evolutionary arms race.

In this video I attempt to lift a 19kg (42 lbs) wheel over my head one-handed while it's spinning at a few thousand RPM. This replicates an earlier experiment by Professor Eric Laithwaite. He claimed the wheel was 'light as a feather' and could not be explained by Newton's Laws. I wanted to find out for myself what I really felt like.

How do you investigate hypotheses? Do you seek to confirm your theory - looking for white swans? Or do you try to find black swans? I was startled at how hard it was for people to investigate number sets that didn't follow their hypotheses, even when their method wasn't getting them anywhere.

In the video I say ""when people came to Australia..."" by which I meant, ""when Europeans who believed all swans were white came to Australia..."" I did not mean any offence to Indigenous Australians who were already in Australia at that time. Please accept my apologies for the poor phrasing if you were offended by it.

This video was inspired by The Black Swan by Nassim Taleb and filmed by my mum. Thanks mum!

Partly my motivation came from responses to my Facebook videos - social media marketers saying 'Facebook ads have worked for me so there can't be fake likes.' Just because you have only seen white swans, doesn't mean there are no black ones. And in fact marketers are only looking for white swans. They think it was invalid of me to make the fake Virtual Cat page: 'well of course if it's a low quality page you're going to get low quality likes.' But my point is this is black swan bait, something they would never make because their theory is confident in the exclusive existence of white swans.","2014-02-24 14:30:02","en",284,16371969,395768,"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/vKA4w2O61Xo/default.jpg",24117,"The Most Common Cognitive Bias","UCHnyfMqiRRG1u-2MsSQLbXA","27"

Want to watch the whole hour of silence? http://youtu.be/jr1UMFC9DV0

Many stories have circulated claiming the longest anyone has stayed in an ultra-quiet anechoic chamber is 45 minutes, the reason being any longer would drive you insane. To me this sounded like unsubstantiated rubbish, like the claim the Great Wall is the only manmade structure visible from space. So I put my own psyche on the line, subjecting myself to over an hour of the most intense quiet on Earth. No, this was not THE quietest room on Earth (-9dB) but it is one of the quietest, and the truth is once you put a person inside, they are by far the loudest thing in there so the sound rating of the room is irrelevant.

I was not surprised to find that I could stay in there for as long as I liked and feel perfectly fine. What was surprising is that my heartbeat was audible. You can hear it on the sound recording. Now I wasn't consciously aware of the sound of my heart while in the room, but I was more aware of the feeling of it beating.

"J3xLuZNKhlY","Empty Space is NOT Empty","Empty Space is NOT Empty","An atom is mostly empty space, but empty space is mostly not empty. The reason it looks empty is because electrons and photons don't interact with the stuff that is there, quark and gluon field fluctuations.
It actually takes energy to clear out space and make a true 'empty' vacuum. This seems incredibly counter-intuitive but we can make an analogy to a permanent magnet. When at low energies, like at room temperature, there is a magnetic field around the magnet due to the alignment of all the magnetic moments of the atoms. But if you add some energy to it by heating it, the particles gain thermal energy, which above the Curie temperature makes their magnetic moments randomly oriented and hence destroying the magnetic field. So in this case energy is needed to clear out the field, just as in the quantum vacuum.

I am collecting a whole pile of other interesting bits and pieces that did not get mentioned in the video and/or popped up in the comments in my post pinned to the top of the comment section of this video. 

Some questions for you to while your time away.
1. In the 3D golden spiral the left-over golden boxes converge to a point on one of the edges of the golden box we start with. In what ratio does this point divide the edge?
2. Which points in a golden rectangle can you reach by cutting off infinitely many squares as in the golden spiral construction? How about in 3d?
3. Nut out some details for the nonagon. What's Binet's formula in that case?
4. For which complex numbers n does Binet's formula spit out an integer/a real number?
5. Is it a coincidence that there is a 1/7 in my Binet's formula for the heptagon? (You can make the 1/5 th appear in Binet's formula itself by multiplying both denominator and numerator by phi +1/phi.)

"oVfHeWTKjag","Facebook Fraud","Facebook Fraud","Evidence Facebook's revenue is based on fake likes.
My first vid on the problem with Facebook: http://bit.ly/1dXudqY
I know first-hand that Facebook's advertising model is deeply flawed. When I paid to promote my page I gained 80,000 followers in developing countries who didn't care about Veritasium (but I wasn't aware of this at the time). They drove my reach and engagement numbers down, basically rendering the page useless. I am not the only one who has experienced this. Rory Cellan-Jones had the same luck with Virtual Bagel: http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-18819338

The US Department of State spent $630,000 to acquire 2 million page likes and then realized only 2% were engaged. http://wapo.st/1glcyZo

I thought I would demonstrate that the same thing is still happening now by creating Virtual Cat (http://www.facebook.com/MyVirtualCat). I was surprised to discover something worse - false likes are coming from everywhere, including Canada, the US, the UK, and Australia. So even those carefully targeting their campaigns are likely being duped into spending real money on fake followers. Then when they try to reach their followers they have to pay again.

And it's possible to be a victim of fake likes without even advertising. Pages that end up on Facebook's ""International Suggested Pages"" are also easy targets for click-farms seeking to diversify their likes. http://tnw.co/NsflrC

Is punishment or reward more effective for helping people learn. A lot of people would say different incentives motivate different people, or in different circumstances, but in psychology there is a sizable body of evidence that in order to learn skills, positive feedback is more effective. This fining has been verified not just with humans, but also with other species.

It was strange then that after Daniel Kahneman discussed this research with Israeli fighter pilot instructors that he was met with resistance. They found the opposite was true: when they reprimanded a cadet for performing poorly, he invariably improved, but if they praised a cadet for an excellent performance, the next attempt was not as good. In order to solve this apparent contradiction we first need to understand regression to the mean.

Magnetism seems like a pretty magical phenomenon. Rocks that attract or repel each other at a distance - that's really cool - and electric current in a wire interacts in the same way. What's even more amazing is how it works. We normally think of special relativity as having little bearing on our lives because everything happens at such low speeds that relativistic effects are negligible. But when you consider the large number of charges in a wire and the strength of the electric interaction, you can see that electromagnets function thanks to the special relativistic effect of length contraction. In a frame of reference moving with the charges, there is an electric field that creates a force on the charges. But in the lab frame, there is no electric field so it must be a magnetic field creating the force. Hence we see that a magnetic field is what an electric field becomes when an electrically charged object starts moving.

Everyone has played with a mixture of corn starch and water (or at least I hope they have). This was one of my favorite experiments as a kid. Your hand slides into the slime easily when moving slowly but the mixture behaves as a solid if you hit it quickly. That is what is meant by 'non-Newtonian' - the fluid's properties change depending on its relative motion. These properties can be exploited to dramatic effect as has been shown on speaker cones before. Here I wanted to understand what is going on, what frequencies and amplitudes work best so I used a slow-mo camera.

We have looked at how a transistor works, the fundamental unit of classical computers, and how a quantum computer works in theory, taking advantage of quantum superposition to hold exponentially more information than classical computers. Now we look at the practical side of making a quantum bit, or qubit. How do you put it in a state where it is stable? How do you read and write information on it? These processes are described for a solid state qubit - a phosphorous atom in a silicon crystal substrate. Both the electron and the nucleus of the phosphorous atom can be used as qubits.

Instead, water is pumped out of the lake by the jetski at up to 60 litres a second. It is then fired out of the nozzles at around 15 m/s creating 1800 N of force, the equivalent of about 150 fire extinguishers. On me this can produce acceleration of about 1.5g's.

When I mentioned to people that I was doing a video on transistors, they would say ""as in a transistor radio?"" Yes! That's exactly what I mean, but it goes so much deeper than that. After the transistor was invented in 1947 one of the first available consumer technologies it was applied to was radios, so they could be made portable and higher quality. Hence the line in 'Brown-eyed Girl' - ""going down to the old mine with a transistor radio.""

But more important to our lives today, the transistor made possible the microcomputer revolution, and hence the Internet, and also TVs, mobile phones, fancy washing machines, dishwashers, calculators, satellites, projectors etc. etc. A transistor is based on semiconductor material, usually silicon, which is 'doped' with impurities to carefully change its electrical properties. These n and p-type semiconductors are then put together in different configurations to achieve a desired electrical result. And in the case of the transistor, this is to make a tiny electrical switch. These switches are then connected together to perform computations, store information, and basically make everything electrical work intelligently.

A quantum computer works in a totally different way from a classical computer. Quantum bits or 'qubits' can exist in a superposition state of both zero and one simultaneously. This means that a set of two qubits can be in a superposition of four states, which therefore require four numbers to uniquely identify the state. So the amount of information stored in N qubits is two to the power of N classical bits.

The Higgs mechanism is meant to account for the mass of everything, right? Well no, only the fundamental particles, which means that electrons derive their mass entirely from the Higgs interaction but protons and neutrons, made of quarks, do not. In fact the quark masses are so small that they only make up about 1% of the mass of the proton (and a similar fraction of the neutron). The rest of the mass comes from the energy in the gluon field. Gluons are massless, but there is so much energy in the field that by E=mc^2 there is a significant amount of mass there. This is where most of your mass comes from and the mass of virtually everything around you.

Support Veritasium on Patreon: http://bit.ly/VePatreon

A kilogram isn't what it used to be. Literally. The original name for it was the 'grave', proposed in 1793 but it fell victim to the French Revolution like its creator, Lavoisier. So begins the tale of the most unusual SI unit. The kilogram is the only base unit with a prefix in its name, and the only one still defined by a physical artifact, the international prototype kilogram or IPK.

But the problem with this definition has long been apparent. The IPK doesn't seem to maintain its mass compared to 40 similar cylinders minted at the same time. The goal is therefore to eliminate the kilogram's dependence on a physical object. Two main approaches are being considered to achieve this end: the Avogadro Project and the Watt Balance.

The Avogadro project aims to redefine Avogadro's constant (currently defined by the kilogram -- the number of atoms in 12 g of carbon-12) and reverse the relationship so that the kilogram is precisely specified by Avogadro's constant. This method required creating the most perfect sphere on Earth. It is made out of a single crystal of silicon 28 atoms. By carefully measuring the diameter, the volume can be precisely specified. Since the atom spacing of silicon is well known, the number of atoms in a sphere can be accurately calculated. This allows for a very precise determination of Avogadro's constant.

Special thanks to Katie Green, Dr. David Farrant, the CSIRO, and the National Measurment Institute for their help. Thanks also to Nessy Hill for filming and reviewing earlier drafts of this video.

There is debate as to whether this is truly the roundest object ever created. The Gravity Probe-B rotors are also spherical with very low tolerances such that they may in fact be rounder.

"GzbKb59my3U","Single Photon Interference","Single Photon Interference","What happens when single photons of light pass through a double slit and are detected by a photomultiplier tube? In 1801 Thomas Young seemed to settle a long-running debate about the nature of light with his double slit experiment. He demonstrated that light passing through two slits creates patterns like water waves, with the implication that it must be a wave phenomenon.

However, experimental results in the early 1900s found that light energy is not smoothly distributed as in a classical wave, rather it comes in discrete packets, called quanta and later photons. These are indivisible particles of light. So what would happen if individual photons passed through a double slit? Would they make a pattern like waves or like particles?","2013-03-13 14:01:06","en",360,1309388,31720,"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/GzbKb59my3U/default.jpg",2837,"Single Photon Interference","UCHnyfMqiRRG1u-2MsSQLbXA","27"

For clarification on this video, please see: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OW7tfrTh66c
What would you see if you were drifting through space, looking back at the sun? Well its light intensity would decrease as the inverse square of distance from the sun. And you would imagine the intensity would decrease smoothly, asymptotically approaching zero.

But this is not what happens.

If you had sensitive enough eyes, like frogs' eyes, you would find that at some point the sun would start to flicker. You would see flashes of light separated by complete darkness. And as you drift further from the sun, what's strange is that these flashes do not decrease in brightness, but they do become less frequent. That's because light comes in lumps, called quanta or photons, which are indivisible. So if you try to spread light out very thinly, you reach a point where there are only single bits of light reaching an observer's eye at any given time.

"Iuv6hY6zsd0","The Original Double Slit Experiment","The Original Double Slit Experiment","Light is so common that we rarely think about what it really is. But just over two hundred years ago, a groundbreaking experiment answered the question that had occupied physicists for centuries. Is light made up of waves or particles?

The experiment was conducted by Thomas Young and is known as Young's Double Slit Experiment. This famous experiment is actually a simplification of a series of experiments on light conducted by Young. In a completely darkened room, Young allowed a thin beam of sunlight to pass through an aperture on his window and onto two narrow, closely spaced openings (the double slit). This sunlight then cast a shadow onto the wall behind the apparatus. Young found that the light diffracted as it passed through the slits, and then interfered with itself, created a series of light and dark spots. Since the sunlight consists of all colours of the rainbow, these colours were also visible in the projected spots. Young concluded that light consist of waves and not particles since only waves were known to diffract and interfere in exactly the manner that light did in his experiment.

The way I have always seen this experiment performed is with a laser and a manufactured double slit but since the experiment was conducted in 1801 I have always thought that it should be possible to recreate the experiment using sunlight and household materials. That is basically what I did here. I will show the interference pattern I observed with my homemade double slit on 2Veritasium but I chose to use a manufactured double slit here to ensure that the pattern was impressive for observers at the beach.

Special thanks to Henry, Brady, and Rupert for their cameos, Glen for filming and Josh for helping create the apparatus. Thanks also to the Royal Society for allowing us to view the original manuscript of Young's lecture and the University of Sydney for lending the double slits.

Subscribe to Veritasium - it's free! http://bit.ly/YSWpWm


But it's not just Australia - it seems like all beautiful, warm places are cursed with venomous native species. So I set out to find the truth: why have all these venomous species evolved in the world's best holiday destinations?

I asked chemists, visited the zoo, interviewed entomologists and snake experts. The answer I found was complicated:
1. The majority of venomous species are ectotherms, cold-blooded creatures whose internal temperatures are governed by their surroundings.
2. This means they have limited periods of activity - mainly while it's warm out, and can only exert short bursts of energy, so they are generally ""sit and wait"" predators. This may explain why they, more than mammals or birds, evolved venom.
3. It also explains why there are more of these species in warm climates. There are more of all species in warm climates, but this trend is especially pronounced for ectotherms.
4. So there are a greater number of venomous species in warm places, simply because there are more species in warm places. Cold climates still have venomous creatures, like the rattlesnakes of Canada and European vipers.
5. But history also has a role to play. In Australia, there were no snakes until 20 million years ago when a venomous sea snake from Asia encountered the land, sending venomous species to all corners of the continent. Later non-venomous arrivals have done well in the tropics but not as well in Australia's colder climates, so venomous types still dominate there. Hawaii has no venomous land snakes and nor does Jamaica.
6. The recent ice age also would have driven ectotherms from the northern parts of the Northern Hemisphere. This is why there are no snakes in Ireland, for example.

In our everyday lives we virtually never come up against this limit, hence why it seems peculiar. In this experiment a laser is shone through a narrow slit onto a screen. As the slit is made narrower, the spot on the screen also becomes narrower. But at a certain point, the spot starts becoming wider. This is because the photons of light have been so localised at the slit that their horizontal momentum must become less well defined in order to satisfy Heisenberg's uncertainty principle.

NASA now tracks around 20,000 pieces of debris orbiting Earth, most of them larger than 10cm across. Since the average speed of a collision between orbiting objects is 10 km/s these pieces of trash can cause a lot of damage despite their small size.

Scientists in Switzerland have a plan to clean up space junk - it involves creating a 'Janitor Satellite' that will seek out pieces of space junk to drag back into the atmosphere causing them to burn up.

For the Sixty Symbols version of this experiment click http://bit.ly/RGfLY5

Michael Faraday created the first electric generator in 1831 using a coil of wire and a permanent magnet. When the magnet was moved relative to the coil, current was induced in the coil. A similar experiment can be performed with a copper tube and a magnet. Although copper is not magnetic, it is a conductor. As the magnet falls through the pipe, the magnetic field changes over different sections of the pipe. This induces swirling currents (called eddy currents), which create a magetic field that opposes the motion of the magnet. This means work must be done to move the magnet through the pipe. This work generates the electrical energy, which is then dissipated as thermal energy in the pipe. The same basic principle is used to generate electricity throughout the world: moving a magnet inside copper coils.

Although its mass has been measured around 125-126 GeV most of the other properties of the particle remain unknown. Its spin appears to be 0 or 2 but more results are required to nail this down. If it is the standard model Higgs, the spin should be 0, resulting in a fairly symmetric distribution of decay products in the detectors.

We may know this year if it's not the standard model Higgs - this would be the case if it doesn't decay into specific particles with the expected frequency. However if it is the standard model Higgs, it may take many more years to be certain. The large hadron collider will be shut down in 2013 for upgrades so that higher energies up to 14 TeV can be tested. Right now the LHC is operating at 8 TeV.

Electromagnetic Induction","At the Palais de la Decouverte in Paris, they showed me this experiment where a 1kg aluminium plate is levitated above a large coil of wire that is being supplied with 800A of alternating current at 900Hz. This is by far the best demonstration of electromagnetic induction I have ever seen.

Back in London, I visited the magnetic lab of Michael Faraday in the basement of the Royal Institution. It was here that he did his groundbreaking work on induction. People had previously observed that current in a wire causes a compass needle to deflect, but more exciting was the prospect of using a magnetic field to generate current. Faraday created his famous induction ring by winding two coils of insulated wire onto an iron ring. When he connected a battery to one coil, a small pulse of current was induced in the other. When the battery was disconnected, current was induced in the other direction. This led Faraday to the conclusion that current was induced in the second coil only when the magnetic field through it was changing.

And if they hadn't been wrapped on the same ring, Faraday may have noticed that the two coils repel each other when the current is induced due to the interaction of their magnetic fields. This is the same thing that is happening with the aluminium plate, except we're using alternating current to create a continually changing magnetic field. This induces an alternating current in the plate, producing an opposing magnetic field which levitates the disk.","2012-10-09 15:57:50","en-GB",226,2476267,39520,"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/txmKr69jGBk/default.jpg",2332,"Levitating Barbecue!

Water boils at room temperature once the pressure is low enough. What is interesting is that this decreases the temperature of the liquid. The fastest molecules escape, leaving the slower ones behind.
Using this trick with liquid nitrogen, it is possible to create solid nitrogen at a temperature of -210C. We then poured the solid and liquid nitrogen mixture onto a tray of water. The surface of the water became so cold that CO2 solidified out of the atmosphere on its surface. Then, since CO2 does not pass through the liquid phase at atmospheric pressure, it was propelled on the water surface by jets of gas as it sublimed.

Is a flame really a plasma? Well it depends on your definition of plasma, but there are certainly ions in a flame, formed as molecules collide with each other at high speed, sometimes knocking electrons off of their atoms.

Special thanks to the Palais de la Decouverte for helping me perform this experiment. Using tens of thousands of volts on two metal plates, we created a strong electric field around the plasma. This pulled positive ions in one direction and negative ions in the other direction elongating the flame horizontally and causing it to flicker like a ""papillon"" (butterfly). Then we showed that much longer sparks can be made through the flame than through air since the ions increase the conductivity.","2012-09-11 19:00:26","en",161,4528210,49189,"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/a7_8Gc_Llr8/default.jpg",2554,"What's In A Candle Flame?","UCHnyfMqiRRG1u-2MsSQLbXA","27"

The longest vertical straw you can use is 10.3 m http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUmZrtiXDik
This is because the weight of water in the straw must be supported by the pressure difference at its two ends. At the bottom, the pressure is atmospheric, and at the top, the lowest pressure you can create is a perfect vacuum (pressure = 0). Atmospheric pressure can support a water column about 10m high - BUT with 0 pressure at the top, the water would start boiling. This is called cavitation and it obviously can't be happening in trees.
After I posted the straw video, I received a lot of questions about how trees could be taler than 10m. I assumed there was a simple answer because there are plenty of trees taller than that. But as I asked around and read articles about it, I couldn't really find an explanation I was happy with.

Maybe there is not a continuous water column inside the tree, so each section only lifts water a little ways? This could be but it seems to require a series of pump mechanisms, and how would you join this pump sections together? Perhaps capillary action is holding the water up? But the xylem tubes in a tree seem too wide (~50 um) for this effect to be significant. Maybe osmotic pressure could push the water from below rather than sucking it up from above? But some trees live in mangroves, where there is much higher solute concentration in the sea water than in their roots, so osmosis would work the other way.

Eventually I spoke to a plant biologist and sorted this all out, but I wanted to give you a little back to school challenge.

More with Canadian Olympian Hunter Lowden: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6YVOPUkbu6g

How does a sailboat work? The standard idea is that the wind pushes the sails from behind, causing the boat to move forward. Although this technique is used at times, it is not the most efficient way to sail a boat (and it means the boat can never go faster than the wind). Lift is the key mechanism driving a boat forwards. As air flows over the sails, it moves faster over the outer side, creating lower pressure than on the inner side. This produces a force which is mostly to the side and a bit forwards. Lift on the centerboard pushes to the opposite side, cancelling the sideways force and adding a forward component of force to the boat.

In truth, the light is created more than 100km above Earth's surface as high speed electrons and protons ejected from the sun in a solar flare or coronal mass ejection collide with air molecules in the upper atmosphere. The charged particles from the sun excite air molecules which then de-excite by emitting light. The display is most common around the north and south poles because the Earth's magnetic field deflects the solar wind from the equator to the poles.

The question has arisen often enough that I thought I'd answer it. If you hold views that are consistent with the majority of the population, does that make you stupid? I don't think so. Science has uncovered a lot of counterintuitive things about the universe, so it's unsurprising that non-scientists hold beliefs inconsistent with science. But when we teach, we must take into account what the learners know, including their incorrect knowledge. That is the reason a lot of Veritasium videos start with the misconceptions.

If you hold a mirror in front of your face, will you see your reflection in a mirror? How could light from your face reach the mirror if the mirror is travelling away from you? But it would be a pretty spooky train if you couldn't see your reflection so Einstein felt this solution wasn't realistic. On the other hand if you could see your reflection, it would mean light was travelling at the speed of light inside the train. But that meant the same light observed from outside the train would be going twice the speed of light. This again seems inconsistent. So Einstein resolved that you must see your reflection but that light must travel at the same speed inside and outside the train. The only way this is possible is if space and time are perceived differently by observers inside and outside the train.","2011-11-01 20:05:36","en",253,2278932,39652,"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/vVKFBaaL4uM/default.jpg",5923,"Can You Go the Speed of Light?","UCHnyfMqiRRG1u-2MsSQLbXA","27"

Most people recognize that the Earth has a big explosion in its history, which they refer to descriptively as the 'Big Bang.' But there are two very good reasons why the Big Bang is not directly responsible for forming the Earth: 1) It happened 13.7 billion years ago. That's more than 9 billion years before the Earth formed (what happened during that time?), and 2) After the Big Bang the universe consisted of only Hydrogen and Helium - not great raw material for building the Earth. The truth is the big bang formed stars, which exploded and then (perhaps) formed more stars, which exploded and then formed our solar system, including the Earth.

Nice geogebra classic animation by Ron Vanden Burg
https://www.geogebra.org/classic/sdftbe2y He chooses a different but equivalent approach to Petr, Douglas and Neumann. He attaches regular n-gons instead of the ears. Instead of connecting the tips of the ears, he connects the centers of the added regular n-gons. And instead of using ears with different angles each round, he adds the regular n-gons where each round has a different distribution of vertices that get to each side of the edge. It has a slider to switch from triangle (n=3) to decagons (n=10) and there is a play button to run through the different stages. Here is an updated version https://www.geogebra.org/classic/ztvrbdyy

Nice applications:

Check out the paragraph entitled ""Intuition"" for an explicit reference to Napoleons theorem.
Being able to find the center of mass of a polygon is another nice application in itself.

Nice remarks:
For a digon we are attaching 2-2=0 360/2-gons to arrive at ... the same digon ... which is automatically regular :)
Adding a 180-degree ear to a segment is the same as bisecting this segment. So the tip of the ear ends up in the middle of the segment. 


Visualisation challenges: I sort of had it going in Mathematica just for 10-gons. An app that allows you to pick the vertices of a closed polygon on a canvas and then calculates the intermediate polygons. One problem with the intermediate polygons is that for acute angles the displacement is large and so that can quickly lead to the intermediate polygons growing too large for your canvas. Some rescaling is probably the way to go. Alternatively, since the end result is always the same no matter the order, it makes sense to apply angles in complementing pairs, jump out and in, and only show every second stage of the evolution. Maybe some app that allows to input a smooth curve and then allows to experiment with different polygon approximations to see whether we get some convergence. The decomposition into the special types is a great one to animate. If you’ve got Mathematica I’ve included what I got up to in the file directory I link to above.

It is a common view that ""if only someone could break this down and explain it clearly enough, more students would understand."" Khan Academy is a great example of this approach with its clear, concise videos on science. However it is debatable whether they really work. Research has shown that these types of videos may be positively received by students. They feel like they are learning and become more confident in their answers, but tests reveal they haven't learned anything. The apparent reason for the discrepancy is misconceptions. Students have existing ideas about scientific phenomena before viewing a video. If the video presents scientific concepts in a clear, well illustrated way, students believe they are learning but they do not engage with the media on a deep enough level to realize that what was is presented differs from their prior knowledge. There is hope, however. Presenting students' common misconceptions in a video alongside the scientific concepts has been shown to increase learning by increasing the amount of mental effort students expend while watching it.","2011-03-17 17:43:58","en",484,1609348,60766,"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/eVtCO84MDj8/default.jpg",3150,"Khan Academy and the Effectiveness of Science Videos","UCHnyfMqiRRG1u-2MsSQLbXA","27"

Why is that? Is it because the gravitational force on them is zero in space? (Or nearly zero?) The truth is that the strength of the gravitational attraction is only slightly less than it is on Earth's surface. So how are they able to float? Well, they aren't floating - they're falling, along with the space station. They don't crash into the Earth because they have a huge orbital velocity. So as they accelerate towards the Earth, the Earth curves away beneath them and they never get any closer. Since the astronauts have the same acceleration as the space station, they feel weightless. It's like being in a free-falling elevator (without the disastrous landing).

So the force the Earth exerts on the moon must be exactly equal and opposite the force the moon exerts on the Earth. But how can that be - that the same size force keeps the moon orbiting, but barely affects the Earth? The answer is inertia - the tendency for all objects with mass to maintain their state of motion.

Instead the resistance felt is an indication of the car's mass which determines its inertia.

It's just chemistry that you and me are made of these atoms:

matter forms something strange
when there's a chemical change?

Where did these atoms come from? They were fused in stars
Light elements combine releasing light from afar
Fusion in the sun, creates Helium

I guess what I be saying is you gotta use your reason
To open up your mind and see the cause of the seasons

A collection of over 100 proofs of Pythagoras theorem at Cut-the-knot https://www.cut-the-knot.org/pythagoras/ (quite a few with animations) I cover proofs 3, 4, 5 ( :),  9, 10, 76, 104.  Other proofs closely related to what I am doing in this video are 55, 89, and 116. 

A very good book that touches on a lot of the material in this video by Claudi Alsina and Roger B. Nelsen - Icons of Mathematics: An Exploration of Twenty Key Images (2011).  Check out in particular chapters 1-3 and chapter 8.3.

Fermat's four square theorem:

Fibonacci seems to be the discoverer of the connection between Pythagorean triples and arithmetic sequences of squares of length 3 https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Congruum

There is an Easter Egg contained in the first proof. Five days after publishing the video only one person appears to have noticed it :) Here is an alternative version of the animation that only uses shifts that I put on Mathologer 2 https://www.youtube.com/shorts/vT9wUpu_Vco

The four bugs problem:
Actually I got something wrong here. Martin Gardner mentioned the four bugs for the first time in 1957 as a puzzle Martin Gardner actually mentioned the four bugs for the first time in 1957 as a puzzle (Gardner, M. November, 1957 Mathematical Games. Nine titillating puzzles, Sci. Am. 197, 140–146.) The 1965 article that is accompanied by the nice cover that I show in the video talks, among many other things, about the more general problem of placing bugs on the corners of a regular n-gon.

Here are a couple of other online resources worth checking out.
https://tinyurl.com/4erz3zmf
https://tinyurl.com/ykvvj5sw

Explanation for distance 1: Because the bug that each bug is walking towards is always moving perpendicular to the first bug’s path, never getting closer or further away from the first bug’s motion. So it has to go exactly the same distance as it was at the beginning.

For the mathematics of various bits and pieces chasing each other check out Paul Nahin's book Chases and Escapes: The Mathematics of Pursuit and Evasion.

They saw a glow from the tube that seemed to emanate from the negatively charged plate called the cathode. Since scientists didn't know what the glow was they called it a cathode ray. There was debate over whether the cathode ray was a wave phenomenon like light or a stream of negatively charged particles. JJ Thomson effectively resolved the debate in 1897 by performing a clever experiment that determined the charge to mass ratio of the particles making up the cathode ray. He also showed that this same particle was in all different cathode materials so it must be a constituent common to all atoms. This changed our understanding of the atom from the previous billiard ball model to Thomson's plum pudding model of the atom.","2011-02-02 06:10:11","en",193,590520,7775,"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/2xKZRpAsWL8/default.jpg",294,"Cathode Rays Lead to Thomson's Model of the Atom","UCHnyfMqiRRG1u-2MsSQLbXA","27"

Archimedes derives the volume and area formulas for the sphere. The proofs used in this work are quite complicated and conform to what was acceptable according to Greek mathematics at the time. His original original ingenious proof most likely involved calculus type arguments.

There is one thing (among quite a few) that I decided to gloss over at the end of the video but which is worth noting here. At the end it’s not straight Cavalieri. Before you apply Cavalieri,  you also need to put some extra thought into figuring out why the flat moon that runs along the semicircular meridian can be straightened out into something that has the same area (straighten meridian spine with interval fishbones at right angles). Here I was tempted to include a challenge for people to figure out why the red and blue surfaces in the attached screenshot have the same area: https://www.qedcat.com/ring.jpg

Funniest comment: Historians attempting to reconstruct the Claw of Archimedes have long debated how the weapon actually worked. The sources seem to have trouble describing exactly what it did, and now we know why. Turns out it was a giant disc that slid beneath the waters of a Roman ship, then raised countless eldritch crescents which inexplicably twisted into a sphere, entrapping the vessel before dragging it under the waves, all while NEVER LEAVING ANY GAPS in the entire process. No escape, no survivors, fucking terrifying. No wonder that Roman soldier killed Archimedes in the end, against the Consul's orders. Gods know what other WMDs this man would unleash on the battlefield if he were allowed to draw even one more circle in the sand. The Roman marines probably had enough PTSD from circles.

Fun/intersting: The opposite of this is a vuvuzela, which is a horn with finite surface but infinite volume (as in loud)

One interesting observation is that both area and volume being finite or infinite is independent of what unit we use. Therefore it does make sense to compare finite/infinite volumes and surface areas of shapes. And one interesting observation in this respect is that solids of infinite volume and finite surface area don't exist. On the other hand, that also means that areas and volumes scaling differently is not part of the resolution of our paradox which only depends on the volume being finite and the surface area being infinite.

07:58 Pi
11:00 Gelfond's number
14:22 Pi exactly
17:35 Riemann's rearrangement theorem
22:40 Thanks!

Riemann rearrangement theorem. 
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Riemann_series_theorem This page features a different way to derive the sums of those nice m positive/n negative term arrangements of the alternating harmonic series by expressing H(n) the sum of the first n harmonic numbers by ln(n) and the  Euler–Mascheroni constant. That could also be made into a very nice visual proof along the lines that I follow in this video https://youtu.be/vQE6-PLcGwU?si=iWTasKqo_JFn4etG&t=1321. 

Gelfond's  number
e^π being approximate equal to 20 + π may not be a complete coincidence after all:
@mathfromalphatoomega
There's actually a sort-of-explanation for why e^π is roughly π+20. If you take the sum of (8πk^2-2)e^(-πk^2), it ends up being exactly 1 (using some Jacobi theta function identities). The first term is by far the largest, so that gives (8π-2)e^(-π)≈1, or e^π≈8π-2. Then using the estimate π≈22/7, we get e^π≈π+(7π-2)≈π+20.  I wouldn't be surprised if it was already published somewhere, but I haven't been able to find it anywhere. I was working on some problems involving modular forms and I tried differentiating the theta function identity θ(-1/τ)=√(τ/i)*θ(τ). That gave a similar identity for the power series Σk^2 e^(πik^2τ). It turned out that setting τ=i allowed one to find the exact value of that sum.
(@kasugaryuichi9767) I don't know if it's new, but it's certainly not well known. To quote the Wolfram MathWorld article ""Almost Integer"": ""This curious near-identity was apparently noticed almost simultaneously around 1988 by N. J. A. Sloane, J. H. Conway, and S. Plouffe, but no satisfying explanation as to ""why"" e^π-π≈20 is true has yet been discovered."" 

Ratio of the number of positive and negative terms
It's interesting to look at the patterns of positive & negative terms when rearranging to Pi.  We always only use one negative term before we switch. The first ten terms on the positive side are: 13, 35, 58, 81, 104, 127, 151, 174, 197, 220,...  If you look at the differences between terms, you get: 22, 23, 23, 23, 23, 24, 23, 23, 23, 23, 23, 23, 23, 24,...
The reason for this is that Gelfond's number is approximately equal to 23. It turns out that if an arrangement of our series has the sum pi, then the ratio of the numbers of positive to negative terms in the finite partial sums of the series converges to Gelfond's number. This is just one step up from what I said about us being able to get arbitrarily close to pi by turning truncations of the decimal expansion of Gelfond's number into fractions. Similarly for other target numbers. For example, to predict what the repeating pattern for e is, you just have to calculate e^e :)

This is the letter that Ramanujan sent to Hardy. Identity VII 6 is closely related to what we are talking about in this video https://www.qedcat.com/misc/ramanujans_letter.jpg  
The answer to Ramanujan's challenge appeared in the February 1916 issue of the Indian Mathematical society (vol. VIII, no. 1, pp. 17–20) ""Answer to Problem 541 by K.B. Madhava"".

Mathologer video ""Euler's infinite pi formula generator"" has a proof for the Wallis product https://youtu.be/WL_Yzbo1ha4?t=465
Discussion on stackexchange of the asymptotic behaviour of the ""square root"" https://tinyurl.com/3yxyhjmp
Also check out the discussion in A. De Morgan, ""On the summation of divergent series"", The Assurance Magazine, and the Journal of the Institute of Actuaries, 12 (1865), pp. 245--252.
Here is a connection to the discussion of ways of associating meaningful values to certain divergent series in the Mathologer videos on 1+2+3+ ""="" -1/12:
log (the product) ""=""  - log 1 + log 2 - log 3 + log 4 - log 5 + log 6 - ... = log 2 - log 3 + log 4 - log 5 + ....
and the last divergent series is known to have Cesaro sum log (pi/2)^(1/2).  (essentially due to Euler, I think). See also exercise 207, page 515, in Knopp's book ""Theorie and Anwendung der unendlichen Reihen"", 2nd edition, Springer, 1924.

Obviously, in the last part of the video, when we plug x=0 into the infinite fraction, we just go for it a la Nike: ""Just do it"", (or a la Ramanujan: 1+.2+3+...=-1/12). Having said that, us ending up with root pi over 2 which is exactly what we want, is really too weird a number to pop up by coincidence. As I said in the video, to really pin down why our manipulations give the right answers is tricky. For example, we need a justification for the way I arrive at the 1/1/2/3/4... fraction in the first place. Usually infinite fractions are evaluated by first turning them into a sequence of partial fractions. Then the value of the infinite fraction, if it exists, is the limit of this sequence. The partial fractions result by truncating the infinite fraction at the plus signs. For many infinite fractions you get a different sequence having the the same limit by truncating at the fractions bars instead.  

A very good book on infinite fractions featuring, among many other things, the Wallis product and the error function: Sergey Khrushchev, Orthogonal polynomials and continued fractions, Cambridge University press, 2008 (p.198, has a high-level proof for our infinite fraction in x rep. of the error function.)

that Martin Powell stumbled upon in 1983. In the end, giving an introduction to Madhava's discoveries and giving that intuitive explanation is what I ended up doing in this video. (""Leibniz formula"" should really be ""Madhava formula""!)

The Wikipedia articles about Madhava, his school and his discoveries are excellent starting points if you are interested in more details:
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madhava_of_Sangamagrama
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madhava%27s_correction_term
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kerala_school_of_astronomy_and_mathematics
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madhava_series

My explanation of how Madhava may have discovered his correction terms is based on this article by Hayashi, T., T. Kusuba, and M. Yano. ""The Correction of the Madhava Series for the Circumference of a Circle."" Centaurus 33 (1990): 149-174. This article is sitting behind a paywall. However, the wiki article linked to above is a good summary.

The original article by Powell in which he reports on his observation and asks for an explanation is here: https://www.jstor.org/stable/3616550
Five explanations were subsequently given in this article published in the same math journal: https://www.jstor.org/stable/3617175 (note on JSTOR this collection of articles is broken up into four parts. This link is only to the first part).

The most in-depth article about the Powell's Pi Paradox is this one here by the Borwein brothers and K. Dilcher on ""Pi, Euler Numbers, and Asymptotic Expansions"": https://www.maa.org/sites/default/files/pdf/pubs/amm_supplements/Monthly_Reference_4.pdf
In this article they also analyse similar paradoxical behaviours of closely related series like  ln(2)=1-1/2+.1/3-1/4+1/5-...

The photo of that palm leaf manuscript page shown at the end of the video was sourced from the slideshow of the 2022 International Congress of Mathematicians invited lecture by K. Ramasubramanian. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctrROj3Tv-E . Also check out his website for LOTS of information about ancient Indian mathematics. https://www.kramasubramanian.com/ I have no idea what it says on this palm leave page, but I trust my colleague to have shown us the right thing here :)

The picture of Madhava in the thumbnail is what Google is pushing. However, this image is not a true likeness of the actual person: https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Madhava_sangamagrama.jpg

In fact, in the drama the tech support ladies can be seen writing from top to bottom. So that's a bit of a blooper when it comes to the writing on the tiles. A few other minor issues are discussed in the comments. What's also interesting here that they went for a 33x33 magic square and 33x33=1089. 1089 is a four-digit number and all the tiles are only labelled with three numerals.

00:00 Intro
00:07 Animated visual proofs
03:35 Mathologer materializes
06:31 Three puzzles
07:45 Thanks!

Notes: 
The beautiful visual proof for the squares pattern is based on a note by Michael Boardman in Mathematics Magazine: https://tinyurl.com/2d4y7wtf

As far as I can tell, I am the first one to notice that this beautiful argument also works for those consecutive integer sums (but I am probably wrong :)

I first read about the two patterns that this video is about in the 1966 book Excursions in Number Theory by Ogilvy and Anderson (pages 91 and 92). 

The article ""Consecutive integers having equal sums of squares"" J.S. Vidger, Mathematics Magazine, Vol. 38, No. 1 (Jan., 1965), pp. 35-42. is dedicated to finding generalisations of the sort of equations that the squares pattern is all about. Here is a particularly, nice example derived at the very end of this article: 4² + ... + 38² = 39² + ... + 48².  This article is on JSTOR https://www.jstor.org/stable/2688015. 

I first encountered the Russian painting that puzzle 2 is about in an article by Ethan Siegel about 10² + 11² + 12² = 13² + 14² and Co. https://tinyurl.com/y7p5k4kw Nice find :)

365 is the smallest integer that can be expressed as a sum of consecutive square in more than one way 365 = 10² + 11² + 12² = 13² + 14² (and of course 365 also happens to be the number of days in a year :) Viewer Exception2001: Knowing the result, it's fun to think about making an efficient one-page calendar where the front is a 13x13 square and the back is a 14x14 square, with each square containing a date :D

Viewer k k notes that consecutive squares also take care of leap years :) 8² + 9² + 10² + 11² = 366 

Christofer Hallberg did some computer experiments and found the following beautiful equation: 4³+...+28³=30³+31³+32³+33³+34³

There are some nice families of equations involving sums of alternating sums of consecutive squares. Check out Roger Nelsen's one glance proof https://tinyurl.com/2xauf83u
               2² - 3² + 4² = -5² + 6²
4² - 5² + 6² - 7² + 8² = -9² + 10² -11² + 12²
                                  ...
Fun fact: the top part of the logo is the top part of the last image I show in the previous video https://youtu.be/94mV7Fmbx88?t=2547

Several viewers (Exception1, Nana Macapagal, B Smith, Shay) noticed that the projected cubes pattern differences are of the form n²(n+1)²/2 = 2(1 + 2 + 3 + ... + n)².
                                             5³ + 6³ = 7³ - 2
                              16³ + 17³ + 18³ = 19³ + 20³ - 18
                    33³ + 34³ + 35³ + 36³ = 37³ + 38³ + 39³ - 72
          56³ + 57³ + 58³ + 59³ + 60³ = 61³ + 62³ + 63³ + 64³ - 200
85³ + 86³ + 87³ + 88³ + 89³ + 90³ = 91³ + 92³ + 93³ + 94³ + 95³ - 450
And that actually means that the nice visual proofs in the video do extend to these modified cubes pattern because the six slices of the cube that I show in the video actually do form the shell of a smaller cube LESS two diametrically opposed corners. 

For the the 4th powers differences the formula is 4³(1 + 2 + 3 + ... + n)³ = 8n³(n+1)³
                                    7⁴ + 8⁴ = 9⁴ - 64
                    22⁴ + 23⁴ + 24⁴ = 25⁴ + 26⁴ - 1728
          45⁴ + 46⁴ + 47⁴ + 48⁴ = 49⁴ + 50⁴ + 51⁴ - 13824
76⁴ + 77⁴ + 78⁴ + 79⁴ + 80⁴ = 81⁴ + 82⁴ + 83⁴ + 84⁴ - 64000
There is another nice piece of 4d hypercube geometry that goes with this observation. 

The new emerging pattern then breaks again with 5th powers. Here the sequence of differences starts like this: 2002, 162066, 2592552, 20002600, 101258850, .... But who knows , ... :)

The triangular numbers tn=1+2+3+...+n that feature prominently in all this arrange themselves into a nice pattern like this
                                 t1+t2+t3=t4
                            t5+t6+t7+t8=t9+t10
                      t11+t12+...+t15=t16+t17+t18
etc.

Solving x² + (x+1)² = (x+2)² has two integer solutions. The first is 3 corresponding to  3² + 4² = 5². The second is -1 corresponding to (-1)² + 0² = 1². You also get a second solution for every other equation in the square pattern. 
           (-1)² + 0² = 1²
(-2)² + (-1)² + 0² = 1² + 2² 
etc.

Donald Sayers and qyrghyz point out that there is a nice discussion of minimal dissections of 6³ into eight pieces that can be reassembled into a 3³ a 4³ and a 5³ in Martin Gardner's book Knotted doughnuts and other mathematical entertainments, pages 198-200. A picture of a dissection like this is shown on this wiki page on Euler's conjecture https://tinyurl.com/27pkbj2c Another dissection here https://tinyurl.com/y6c6tbj4

theoriginalstoney and Michael Morad observed that at 39:28 (last section, extra special Fibonacci)  the difference between the two righthand numbers (4 and 5, 12 and 13, 30 and 34, 80 and 89) are also squares of the Fibonacci numbers: F_(2n+3) - 2 F_(n+1) F_(n+2)=(F_n)^2

Éric Bischoff comments that the trick to get a right angle at 25:40 is popularized in French under the name ""corde d'arpenteur"". This term refers to a circular rope with 12 equally spaced nodes. If you pull 3, 4 and 5-node sides so the rope is tense, you get a right angle. See article ""Corde à nœuds"" on Wikipedia

Various viewers told me what F.J.M. stands for: Fredericus Johannes Maria Barning, Freek, b. Amsterdam 03.10.1924,  master's degree in mathematics Amsterdam GU 1954|a|,  employee Mathematical Center (1954-),  deputy director Mathematical Center, later Center for Mathematics and Informatics (1972-1988) Deceased. Amstelveen 27.06.2012, begr. Amsterdam (RK Bpl. Buitenveldert) 04.07.2012.

John Klinger remarks that if the four numbers in the box are viewed as fractions, the two fractions are equal to the tangents of half of each of the two acute angles of the triangle.

Colin Pountney: Here is another piece in the jigsaw. The link to Pascals triangle. It only works for the Fermat series of triples (ie the set of ""middle children""). Choose any row in Pascals triangle. Multiply the odd entries by 1, 2, 4, 8, ..... and add to get the top left entry in a Fibonacci box. Do the same with the even entries to get the top right entry. For example taking the 1 5  10  10  5  1 row, we have  top left number = 1*1 + 2*10 + 4*5  = 21. Top right number = 1*5 + 2*10 + 4*1 =29. For example taking the 1  6  15  20  15  6  1 row we have top left = 1*1 + 2*15 + 4*15 + 8*1 = 99. Top right = 1*6 + 2*20 + 4*6 =70. Not obviously useful, but it seems to make things more complete.

Ricardo Guzman: Another cool property of Fibonacci numbers:  Take any 3 consecutive Fibonacci numbers:  55,89,144.  The difference of squares of the larger two, divided by the smallest, is the next Fibonacci. .... Thus, in interesting ways the Fibonacci numbers are intertwined with the squares.  

CM63: This suggested the attached figure to me.

In reply I suggested to extend this picture a spiral using these identities: phi^2=phi+1, phi^3=phi^2+phi, phi^4=phi^3+phi^2 :)

According to this note on the relevant wiki page https://tinyurl.com/yv3fnac2 if you take overlaps of the Pythagorean tree into consideration the area of the tree is finite.

Two more interesting notes on the cut-the-knot page:
1. Let the angles of the triangle be 2α, 2β, 2γ so that α + β + γ = 90°. The identity RGP = r²(R + G + P) is equivalent to the following trigonometric formula: cotα + cotβ + cotγ = cotα cotβ cotγ, where ""cot"" denotes the standard cotangent function. More on this here https://tinyurl.com/yrsuhthk
2. A supercute way to derive Pythagoras from Heron with one line of calculus 
https://www.cut-the-knot.org/pythagoras/HeronsDerivative.shtml

For a cyclic quadrilateral that also has an incircle we have a+b=c+d and it follows that the area is just square root of the product of all of the sides.

Another interesting observation extending the fact that the 3-4-5 right-angled triangle has incircle radius 1: In general, the incircle radius of any right-angled triangle with integer sides is an integer.

Scaling the equations at this time code: https://youtu.be/IguNXoCjBEk?t=256: 
length, area and ""volume"" start out the same with radius 1: length=area=volume. 
When you scale by r, these values scale in this way Length = length * r, Area = area * r^2 and Volume = ""volume"" r^3. Therefore, Length = length * r = area *r and so (multiply through with r) Length* r = area *r ^2 = Area, etc.

Typo spotted: At the very end, in Brahmagupta's Formula the third bracket should be (A+C+D-B) not (A+B+D-B).

Sadly,  all these slide rules are linear slide rules. There are some circular slide rules apps made for mobile devices. However, I don't like any of them, except for the German WWII submarine Angriffsscheibe (=attack disk) app Sub Buddy which contains a circular slide rule (not free :(

It would be great if one of you could make a nice circular slide rule online app. Optional features could include: 1. input fields for numbers that are multiplied or divided and then the automatic execution of the slide rule actions with the scales spinning as in this video; 2. infinite precision by making it possible to zoom in on the scales and have it refine automatically; 3. tick box for squaring, as we rotate the two inputs for multiplying are kept the same; 4. incorporation of other look-up scales or even log-log scales; 5. Change of base. :)

Some of you commented that the number shown on the t-shirt was just truncated at the 4th decimal and not rounded. Well, strictly speaking it's wrong no matter whether you round or just chop off as the designer of this t-shirt did :)

Nice concise summary of why the circumference of the wheel is ln(10): At any given moment, the numerical scale of the unwrapped band is proportional to 1/x, where x is the number entering the wheel. So this is a really nice way to see that the integral of 1/x is a logarithmic function.

https://youtu.be/mYAahN1G8Y8

It's a clip taken from the movie X+Y aka A brilliant young mind. The math(s) problem that Nathan, the main character in this movie, is working on in this clip is a simplified version of the first part of a problem that was shortlisted for the 2009 International Mathematical Olympiad. Here is a link to the shortlist. 

https://www.imo-official.org/problems/IMO2009SL.pdf

The problem in question is problem C1 (the number 50 in the problem has been replace by the number 2 in the clip). This problem was suggested to the makers of the movie by Lee Zhao one of the maths consultants of the movie. This Note that the file I've linked to ere also includes solutions.

This problem was invented by Michael Albert who is a mathematician and computer scientist working at the University of Otago in New Zealand. 

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_H._Albert

The 4-colour puzzle that I am challenging you with at the end of this video was invented specifically for the movie X+Y by the U.K. mathematician Geoff Smith who was another math consultant for the movie.  

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geoff_Smith_(mathematician)

Geoff Smith also served for many years as the leader of the United Kingdom team at the International Mathematical Olympiad and is the current president of the IMO board. He also appears in a cameo role in the movie. He is sitting next to Nathan's mother in the corridor outside the hall in which the math(s) olympiad is taking place at the end of the movie.

One volume of Schaum's outlines is dedicated to ""The calculus of finite differences and difference equations"" (by Murray R. Spiegel) Examples galore!

This is a really nice very old book Calculus Of Finite Differences  by George Boole  (published in 1860!) https://tinyurl.com/3bdjr932 Thanks to Ian Robertson for recommending this one.

There is a wiki page about our mystery sequence: https://tinyurl.com/uwc89yub It's got a proof for why the mystery sequence counts the maximal numbers of regions cut by those cutting lines. If you have access to the book ""The book of Numbers"" by John Conway and Richard Guy, it's got the best proof I am aware of.

Here is a sketch of how you solve the Fibonacci difference equation to find Binet's formula https://imgur.com/a/Btu5ZVk

Here are a couple more beautiful gems that I did not get around to mentioning:
1. When we evaluate the G-N formula for 2^n what we are really doing is adding the entries in the nth row of Pascal's triangle (which starts with a 0th row :) And, of course, adding these entries really gives 2^n.

2. Evaluating the G-F formula for 2^n at n= -1 gives 1-1+1-1+... which diverges but whose Cesaro sum is 2^(-1)=1/2!! Something similar happens for n=-2.

3. In the proof at the end we also show that the difference of n choose m is n choose m-1. This implies immediately that the difference of the mth falling power is m times the difference of the m-1st falling power.

If you don't have Mathematica, you can have a look at pdf versions of the programs that are also part of the zip archive or you can use the free CDF player to open the cdf versions of the notebooks.

Something I forgot to mention: There is also another purely algebraic incarnations of this process of growing the cubes. It comes in the form of a recursion formula that connects the different numbers of bits and pieces in consecutive dimensions. That recursion formula is also present at the bottom of the ""iron man page"". Have a close look :) Also, in the Marvel movies the cube that Tony Stark is holding in the thumbnail of this video is called the Tesseract. Probably worth pointing out that ""tesseract"" is another name for a 4-d cube. I also built an easter egg into the thumbnail that plays on this fact:

Here is a really nice video on the 120-cell that I only mentioned in passing.

https://youtu.be/MFXRRW9goTs

Noteworthy from the comments:
Today's video was ""triggered"" by a comment made by Godfrey Pigott on the last video on Moessner's miracle in which he pointed out that (x+2)^n  captures the vital statistics of the n-dimensional cube.

Z. Michael Gehlke There is an easy way to see this: (x^1 + 2*x^0) describes the parts of a line; all of the cubes are iterated products of lines: n-cube = (1-cube)^n. Therefore, all cubes are described by iterated powers of (x^1 + 2*x^0)^n. (Me: Nice insight. Of course needs some fleshing out to make this work on it's own, like in the comment by ...

HEHEHE I AM A SUPAHSTAR SAGA I came up with an even simpler visual proof. Take a cube of side length x+2. This cube has a volume (x+2)^3. Now, slice the cube six times. Each slicing plane is parallel to a face and 1 unit deeper than the face. Don't throw away any volume. What you're left with is an inner cube of side length x (volume x^3), 6 square pieces of volume x^2, 12 edge pieces of volume x, and 8 corner cubes with volume 1 each. Adding up these volumes gives you the original (x+2)^3 volume, so it's proven. This works in any dimension.

If after watching this video you'd like to find out more about Moessner's result, the following PhD thesis features a very comprehensive bibliography: https://ebooks.au.dk/aul/catalog/book/213

The proof by Karel Post that I matholologerise in the second half of this video is contained in this paper:

Karel A. Post. Moessnerian theorems. How to prove them by simple graph theoretical inspection. Elemente der Mathematik, (2):46–51, 1990.

Post also proves a couple of generalisations of Moessner's theorem. Another good write-up of the same proof can be found in Ross Honsberger""s 1991 book More Mathematical Morsels. Honsberger says about Moessner that ""he was internationally known in the field of recreational mathematics for many spectacular results in arithmetic"". Have to have a closer look at some point at what else exactly he did :)

Post's article can be accessed here: https://www.e-periodica.ch (search for ""Moessnerian theorems""). Sadly most other articles about Moessner's theorem are located behind paywalls. 

Here is another very pretty proof of the basic cubes result by Anthony Harradine and Anita Ponsaing using actual 3d cubical shells https://www.qedcat.com/misc/StrikeMeOut.pdf

It's well worth exploring further than what I get around to reporting in this video. If you do, you'll discover interesting connections with super-factorials, higher-dimensional counterparts of Pascal's triangle, and so on.

Challenge for the programmers among you: write a program that turns a sequence of highlighted integers into the corresponding Moessner sequence.

Then, if all the pigeons are in the holes, at least one of the holes must house at least two of the pigeons. Completely obvious. However, this unassuming pigeon hole principle strikes all over mathematics and yields some really surprising, deep and beautiful results. In this video I present my favourite seven applications of the pigeon hole principle.

Starting with a classic, the puzzle of hairy twins, we then have a problem with pigeons on a sphere, a pigeon powered explanation of recurring decimals, some party maths, a very twisty property of the Rubik’s cube, a puzzler from the 1972 International Mathematical Olympiad,  and, finally, what some people consider to be the best mathematical card trick of all time.

For the most accessible exposition of iterated shuffling that I am aware of have a look at the relevant chapter in the book ""Integer partitions"" by Andrews and Eriksson. They also have a nice set of exercises that walk you through proofs for the properties of iterated shuffling that I mention in this video. 

I used Dan Romik's old Mac program ""ASM Simulator"" to produce the movie of the random tilings of growing Aztec diamond boards https://www.math.ucdavis.edu/~romik/software/ Sadly this program does not work on modern Macs. 

The arctic heart at the end of the video is a ""chistmasized"" version of an image from the article ""What is a Dimer"" by Richard Kenyon and Andrei Okounkov https://www.ams.org/notices/200503/what-is.pdf Thank you for letting me use this image.

Around the same time that Kasteleyn published the paper I showed in the video, the physicists  Temperley and Fisher published similar results, Dimer problem in statistical mechanics-an exact result, Philosophical Magazine, 6:68, (1961) 1061-1063. The way Kasteleyn as well as Temperley and Fisher calculated the numbers of tilings of  boards with square tiles was a bit more complicated than the nice refinement that I show in the video which is due to Jerome K. Percus, One more technique for the dimer problem. J. Mathematical Phys., 10:1881–1888, 1969.

Today's bug report: 
I got the formula for the number of regions slightly wrong in the video. It needs to be adjusted by +n. In their paper Poonen and Rubenstein count the number of regions that a regular n-gon is divided into by their diagonals. So this formula misses out on the n regions that have a circle segment as one of their boundaries.

36:34 Chapter 7: Outramanujing Ramanujan

This was supposed to be a short video but in the end turned out to be quite a tricky to sort out. Anyway, as it sometimes happens, I got carried away and now the video really covers a lot of ground : Pell equations, visualising continued fractions by dissecting rectangles into squares, the relationship between continued fractions and the Euclidean algorithm, the irrationality of root 2. Overall quite a few things that you won't find anywhere else :)

The way I tell the anecdote in this video is based on the following account by Ramanujan's friend Prasanta Mahalanobis: Current Science, Vol. 9 (3), pp. 74-75.

""On another occasion, I went to his room to have lunch with him. The First World War had started some time ago. I had in my hand a copy of the monthly Strand Magazine which at that time used to publish a number of puzzles to be solved by the readers. Ramanujan was stir­ring something in a pan over the fire for our lunch. I was sitting near the table, turning over the pages of the Strand Magazine. I got interested in a problem involving a rela­tion between two numbers. I have forgotten the details but I remember the type of the problem. Two British offi­cers had been billeted in Paris in two different houses in a long street; the two numbers of these houses were related in a special way; the problem was to find out the two numbers. It was not at all difficult; I got the solution in a few minutes by trial and error. In a joking way, I told Ramanujan, 'Now here is a problem for you'. He said, 'What problem, tell me', and went on stirring the pan. I read out the question from the Strand Magazine. He promptly answered 'Please take down the solution' and dictated a continued fraction. The first term was the solu­tion which I had obtained. Each successive term repre­sented successive solutions for the same type of relation between two numbers, as the number of houses in the street would increase indefinitely. I was amazed and I asked him how he got the solution in a flash. He said, 'Immediately I heard the problem it was clear that the solution should obviously be a continued fraction; I then thought, which continued fraction? And the answer came to my mind. It was just as simple as this.' ""

There is a complete digital archive of The Strand magazine. You can find the page with the puzzle here: https://tinyurl.com/y2lnb8xf (page 790) 

If you read the puzzle in the Strand you'll find that the problem is actually phrased somewhat differently to what Mahalanobis remembers and Mahalanobis also does not spell out the infinite fraction that Ramanujan came up with. And if you do the math(s) some of the other things he says also don't quite sound right. What I am presenting in this video is my best guess for what really happened.

In particular, the continued fraction that I am talking about in video is probably the most natural candidate for Ramanujan's infinite fraction, but others have argued that it could have been a different continued fraction (which I don't buy :) You can find these other infinite fractions here: 'Ramanujan's Continued Fraction for a Puzzle"" by Poo-Sung Park https://tinyurl.com/yyfdscgr and here 'On Ramanujan, continued fractions and an interesting street number' by John Butcher https://tinyurl.com/yy6nv2yg

Solution to the red cross puzzle from Dudeney's book ""Amusements in Mathematics"" p. 168  :) https://imgur.com/a/bBuLOZN

Another interesting way to systematically search for solutions to the Strand puzzle is this: The equation we want to solve is 2 x^2=y^2+y. You can rewrite this as x^2 = y(y+1)/2. The formula on the right is just the formula for 1+2+3+...+y. So just keep adding 1+2+3+... and at every step check whether the number you get is a square ... :)

https://nrich.maths.org/657/solution

The music in this video is by Chris Haugen, Fresh Fallen Snow (playing in the video) and Morning Mandolin (for the credits)

A couple of remarks:
1. Probably the simplest way to deduce the sin and tan parts of the rational trig ratio theorem is to realise that they follow from the cos part via the trigonometric identities: sin(x)=cos(90-x) and tan^2(x) = (1-cos(2x))/(1+cos(2x)). Note that the second identity implies that if tan(x) is rational, then cos(2x) is rational (if tan(x)=c/d, then tan^2(x)=c^2/d^2=C/D and cos(2x)=(D-C)/(D+C)). 

2. Bug report. 
a) Here I redefine cos(120◦) = 1. 
https://youtu.be/sDfzCIWpS7Q?t=1362
Remarkable :(
b) This transition to the good stuff I clearly did not think through properly.
https://youtu.be/sDfzCIWpS7Q?t=1018
It's possible to make this work for all regular n-gons. There is only one complication that occurs for n's that are of the form 2 * odd. For the corresponding regular n-gons, if you pick up the edges in the order that they appear around the n-gon and assemble them into a star, things close up into (n/2)-stars. For all other n, things work exactly as I showed in the video. Having said that you can also assemble the edges of one of the exceptions into stars. Have a look at this https://imgur.com/68A3fEe and you'll get the idea. Anyway lots more nice side puzzles to be explored here if you are interested  :)

Quadratic Reciprocity MASTERCLASS","The longest Mathologer video ever, just shy of an hour (eventually it's going to happen :) One video I've been meaning to make for a long, long time. A Mathologerization of the Law of Quadratic Reciprocity. This is another one of my MASTERCLASS videos. The slide show consists of 550 slides and the whole thing took forever to make. Just to give you an idea of the work involved in producing a video like this, preparing the subtitles for this video took me almost 4 hours. Why do anything as crazy as this? Well, just like many other mathematicians I consider the law of quadratic reciprocity as one of the most beautiful and surprising facts about prime numbers. While other mathematicians were inspired to come up with ingenious proofs of this theorem, over 200 different proofs so far and counting, I thought I contribute to it's illustrious history by actually trying me very best of getting one of those crazily complicated proofs within reach of non-mathematicians, to make the unaccessible accessible :) Now let's see how many people are actually prepared to watch a (close to) one hour long math(s) video :)

This video was inspired by Matt Baker's ingenious recasting of of a 1830 proof of the LAW by the Russian mathematician Zolotarev in terms of dealing a deck of cards. Here is Matt's blog post that got me started (written for mathematicians):

https://mattbaker.blog/2013/07/03/quadratic-reciprocity-and-zolotarevs-lemma/

If you want to read up on the properties of the sign of a permutation that I am using in this video, Matt also has a nice write-up of this.

The first teaching semester at the university where I teach is about to start and all my teaching and lots of other stuff will happen this semester. This means I won't have much time for any more crazily time-consuming projects like this. Galois theory will definitely has to wait until the second half of this year :(  Still, quite a bit of beautiful doable stuff coming up. So stay tuned.

The first ten minutes of the video are an introduction to the theorem and its history. The presentation of the new proof runs from 10:00 to 21:00. Later on I also present a proof that there is only one way to write 4k+1 primes as the sum of two squares of positive integers. 

I learned about the new visual proof from someone who goes by the YouTube name TheOneThreeSeven. What TheOneThreeSeven pointed out to me was a summary of the windmill proof by Moritz Firsching in this mathoverflow discussion: https://mathoverflow.net/questions/31113/zagiers-one-sentence-proof-of-a-theorem-of-fermat
In turn Moritz Firsching mentions that he learned this proof from Günter Zieger and he links to a very nice survey of proofs of Fermat's theorem by Alexander Spivak that also contains the new proof (in Russian): Крылатые квадраты (Winged squares), Lecture notes for the mathematical circle at Moscow State University, 15th lecture 2007: http://mmmf.msu.ru/lect/spivak/summa_sq.pdf

P.S.: Added a couple of hours after the video went live: 
One of the things that I find really rewarding about making these videos is all the great feedback here in the comments. Here are a few of the most noteworthy observations so far:
- Based on feedback by one of you it looks like it was the Russian math teacher and math olympiad coach Alexander Spivak discovered the windmill interpretation of Zagier's proof; see also the link in the description of this video.
- Challenge 1 at the very end should (of course :) be: an integer can be written as a difference of two squares if and only if it is odd or a multiple of 4.
-one of you actually ran some primality testing to make sure that that 100 digit number is really a prime. Based on those tests it's looking good that this is indeed the case :)
- one of you actually found this !!! 6513516734600035718300327211250928237178281758494417357560086828416863929270451437126021949850746381 = 16120430216983125661219096041413890639183535175875^2 + 79080013051462081144097259373611263341866969255266^2
- a nice insight about the windmill proof for Pythagoras's theorem is that you can shift the two tilings with respect to each other and you get different dissection proofs this way. Particularly nice ones result when you place the vertices of the large square at the centres of the smaller squares :)
- proving that there is only one straight square cross: observe that the five pieces of the cross can be lined up into a long rectangle with short side is x. Since the area of the rectangle is the prime p, x has to be 1. Very pretty :)
- Mathologer videos covering the ticked beautiful proofs in the math beauty pageant:
e^i pi=-1 : https://youtu.be/-dhHrg-KbJ0 (there are actually a couple of videos in which I talk about this but this is the main one)
infinitely many primes: Mentioned a couple of times: This video has a really fun proof off the beaten track:https://youtu.be/LFwSIdLSosI

- When you start with the 11k windmill and then alternate swapping yz and the footprint construction, you'll start cycling through  different windmill solutions and will eventually reach one of the solutions we are really interested in.

Leibniz's formula pi/4 = 1-1/3+1/5-1/7+... is one of the most iconic pi formulas. It is also one of the most surprising when you first encounter it. Why? Well, usually when we see pi we expect a circle close-by. And there is definitely no circle in sight anywhere here, just the odd numbers combining in a magical way into pi. However, if you look hard enough you can discover a huge circle at the core of this formula. 

Here is a link to the relevant chapter in Hilbert and Cohn-Vossen's book Geometry and the Imagination (Google books). I am pretty sure that the idea and proof for the circle proof of the Leibniz formula that I mathologerise in this video first appeared in this book and is due to the authors: https://books.google.com.au/books?id=7WY5AAAAQBAJ&lpg=PA44&pg=PA37#v=onepage&q&f=false

There is also a neat generalisation to what we talked about in this video to the solution of the Basel problem - in terms of the lattice points in a 4-dimensional sphere and the 4-square counterpart of the 4(good-bad) theorem.

After all, they do lots of polynomial torturing in schools and the discovery of the cubic formula is considered to be one of the milestones in the history of mathematics. It's all a bit of a mystery and our mission today is to break through this mathematical wall of silence!  Lots of cubic (and at the very end quartic) surprises ahead. 

A great starting point for further exploration of this topic is this wiki page:

Closest to what I do in this video is this paper

Extra Superman commented: At 3:12, the cubic equation that you choose is in one of two infinite families.The first one: for odd n, x^3 - 3nx - (n^3+1). The second one: for odd n, x^3 + 3nx - (n^3-1).

Thank you very much to Marty for all his help with polishing the presentation and Andrea for his help with pronouncing all those Italian words.

"O1sPvUr0YC0","2000 years unsolved: Why is doubling cubes and squaring circles impossible?","2000 years unsolved: Why is doubling cubes and squaring circles impossible?","Today's video is about the resolution of four problems that remained open for over 2000 years from when they were first puzzled over in ancient Greece: Is it possible, just using an ideal mathematical ruler and an ideal mathematical compass, to double cubes, trisect angles, construct regular heptagons, or to square circles?

00:00 Intro
05:19 Level 1: Euclid
08:57 Level 2: Descartes
16:44 Level 3: Wantzel
24:00 Level 4: More Wantzel
31:30 Level 5: Gauss
35:18 Level 6: Lindemann
40:22 Level 7: Galois

Towards the end of a pure maths degree students often have to survive a ""boss"" course on Galois theory and somewhere in this course they are presented with proofs that it is actually not possible to accomplish any of those four troublesome tasks. These proofs are easy consequences of the very general tools that are developed in Galois theory. However, taken in isolation, it is actually possible to present proofs that don't require much apart from a certain familiarity with simple proofs by contradiction of the type used to show that numbers like root 2 are irrational. 

I've been meaning to publish a nice exposition of these ""simple"" proofs ever since my own Galois theory days (a long, long time ago.
Finally, today is the day :)

For some more background reading I recommend:
1. chapter 3 of the book ""What is mathematics?"" by Courant and Robbins (in general this is a great book and a must read for anybody interested in beautiful maths).
2. The textbook ""Field theory and its classical problems"" by Hadlock (everything I talk about and much more, but you need a fairly strong background in maths for this one). 

Here is a great two-page summary by the mathematician Drew Armstrong of what is going on in this video
http://www.math.miami.edu/~armstrong/461sp11/ImpossibleConstructions.pdf

Here is a derivation of the cubic polynomial for the regular heptagon construction by (I think) the mathematician Reinhard Schultz  http://math.ucr.edu/~res/math153/s10/history09a.pdf
(there is a little typo towards the bottom of the page. It should be 8 cos^3 theta + 4 cos^2 theta - (!) 4 cos theta -1 = 0. Replace cos theta by x and you get the cubic equation I mention in the video. )

Here is an interesting paper that explores why Wantzel's results did not get recognised during his lifetime https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S031508600900010X

Thank you to Marty and Karl for your help with creating this video. And thank you to Cleon Teunissen for pointing out that the picture of Pierre Wantzel that I use in this video is actually not showing Pierre Wantzel but rather Gustave Gaspard de Coriolis who was also a mathematician and lived around the same time as Pierre Wantzel. It appears that whenever there does not exist an actual picture of some person Google and other internet gods simply declare some more or less random picture to be the real thing. See also this page by the SciFi writer Greg Egan who made sure that no actual picture of himself is to be found on the internet: https://www.gregegan.net/images/GregEgan.htm

Today's video is about plane shapes that, just like circles, have the same width in all possible directions. That non-circular shapes of constant width exist is very counterintuitive, and so are a lot of the gadgets and visual effects that are ""powered"" by these shapes: interested in going for a ride on non-circular wheels or drilling square holes anybody? 

While the shapes themselves and some of the tricks they are capable of are quite well known to maths enthusiasts, the newly discovered constant width magic that today's video will culminates in will be new to pretty much everybody watching this video (even many of the experts :)

https://demonstrations.wolfram.com/DrillingASquareHole/ An interactive demo illustrating how a perfect square hole (NO rounded corners) can be drilled using a special shape of constant width. 

Probably the most accessible intro to shapes of constant width is the chapter on these shapes in the book ""The enjoyment of mathematics"" by Rademacher and Toeplitz.

This article which I also mention in the video is behind a paywallMasferrer Leon, C. and Von Wuthenau Mayer, S. Reinventing the Wheel: Non-Circular Wheels, The Mathematical Intelligencer 27 (2005), 7–13.

Just found a Japanese toyshop the other day that sells wooden Nothing grinders https://global.rakuten.com/en/store/good-toy/item/c-006?s-id=rgm-top-en-browsehist  and  a wooden Reuleaux triangle that can be rotated inside a square https://global.rakuten.com/en/store/good-toy/item/c-018?s-id=rgm-top-en-browsehist

I didn't mention them in the video but there are also 3d shapes of constant width which are also very much worth checking out. All the touching stuff I talk about in this video generalises to these 3d shapes.

This video is the result of me obsessing about pinning down the ultimate explanation for what is going on with the mysterious nothing grinder aka the do nothing machine aka the trammel of Archimedes. I think what I present in this video is it in this respect, but I let you be the judge. Featuring the Tusi couple (again), some really neat optical phenomenon based on the Tusi couple (I first encountered this here: https://youtu.be/pNe6fsaCVtI), the ellipsograph and lots of original twists to an ancient theme.

Here is a link to a .zip archive containing 3d printable .stl files of the models featuring the Mathologer logo that I showed in the video: http://www.qedcat.com/misc/grinder.zip

I usually trim the corners and excess material off the (slightly slanted) vertical edges of the three sliders to make them run without catching on anything. I also sharpen the points of the pins a bit before pushing them into the sliders. They lock in place automatically, you don't have to glue them in.

Other 3d printable incarnations featuring different numbers of sliders are floating around on the net—for example search nothing grinder/do nothing machine/Archimedes trammel on https://www.thingiverse.com 

The wiki page on the nothing grinder is also worth visiting: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trammel_of_Archimedes

My current bout of nothing grinder obsession started with Naomi a year 10 student from Melbourne who did a week of mathematical work experience with me at Monash university a couple of weeks ago. As her project she chose to design a 3d printable version of the wooden model that you see in the video. Her Rhino3d files of the square and hexagon grinders served as the starting point for the models you can see in action in the video.

For the longest time I was convinced that these proofs were simply out of reach of a self-contained episode of Mathologer, and I even said so in a video on transcendental numbers last year. Well, I am not teaching any classes at uni this semester and therefore got a bit more time to spend on YouTube. And so I thought why not sink some serious time into trying to make this “impossible” video anyway. I hope you enjoy the outcome and please let me know in the comments which of the seven levels of enlightenment that make up this video you manage to conquer. Even if you just make it to the end of level one it will be an achievement and definitely worth it :)

Today’s video would have been impossible without the help from my analyst colleague and friend Marty Ross who did most of the heavy lifting in terms of identifying and adapting the least crazy transcendence proofs for e and pi in existence for this video. 

Here is Marty’s writeup of the infinite series based proof that e is not a quadratic irrational  http://www.qedcat.com/notes/e%20not%20quadratic.pdf      and here is his formal write-ups of the proofs for the transcendence of pi and e that this video is based on http://www.qedcat.com/notes/e%20+%20pi%20transcendental.pdf. Marty’s version of the proofs is  based on this paper  by Steinberg and Redheffer  https://projecteuclid.org/download/pdf_1/euclid.pjm/1103051870 which in turn has its origins in a proof by David Hilbert http://www.cs.toronto.edu/~yuvalf/Hilbert%20Ueber%20die%20Transzendenz%20der%20Zahlen%20e%20und%20pi.pdf.

This video is about the absolutely wonderful wobbly table theorem. A special case of this theorem became well-known in 2014 when Numberphile dedicated a video to it: A wobbling square table can often be fixed by turning it on the spot. 

Today I'll show you why and to what extent this trick works, not only for square tables but also general rectangular ones. I'll also let you in on the interesting history of this theorem and I'll tell you how a couple of friends and I turned the ingenious heuristic argument for why stabilising-by- turning should work into a proper mathematical theorem.

Here is a link to a preprint of the article by Bill Baritompa, Rainer Löwen, Marty Ross and me that I refer to in the video: http://arxiv.org/abs/math/0511490 . This preprint is pretty close to the printed article that appeared in the Mathematial Intelligencer and which lives behind a pay wall, Math. Intell. 29(2), 49-58 (2007). The argument that I show you in this video is somewhat different from the one Bill, Rainer, Marty and I used in our paper. It's a mix of what we do in our paper and the original argument by Miodrag Novacovic as presented by Martin Gardner in his Mathematical Games column.

Here is a link to the 2014 Numberphile video on table turning featuring the prominent German mathematician Matthias Kreck http://youtu.be/OuF-WB7mD6k

And this is an article by Andre Martin that features an alternative proof for why stabilising-by-turning works for square tables on continuous grounds that are not too steep:   http://arxiv.org/abs/math-ph/0510065

Today’s video was motivated by an amazing animation of a picture of Homer Simpson being drawn using epicycles. This video is about making sense of the mathematics epicycles. Highlights include the surprising shape of the Moon’s orbit around the Sun, instructions on how you can make your own epicycle drawings, and a crash course of complex Fourier series to make sense of it all.

The original Homer epicycle video “Ptolemy and Homer” by Ramiro Serra and Cristián Carman posted on their friend's Santiago Ginnobili's YouTube channel can be found here https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVuU2YCwHjw 
In the video I attribute the animation to Santiago which is a mistake. Also Ramiro told me that unlike what it said in ""Ptolemy and Homer"" their animation actually involved 10000 and not just 1000 epicycles.

The ""Monkey number"" is the average number of twists it takes to solve a Rubik's cube starting from a randomly chosen scrambled position and by making random twists. It's pretty obvious that this number will be gigantic but nobody knows the exact value of this number nor even how gigantic a number we are talking about. 

So what are the Monkey numbers for the 3x3x3 or the 2x2x2? How do you create a mathematically certified random scramble of a Rubik's cube? And how would a virtual Monkey solver fare in an actual speedcubing competition? Accompany me the Mathologer, my friend Erich Tomanek and our pet monkey as we explore these and other confounding Rubik's cube puzzles.  

Check out Erich's infinite monkey lab website: http://www.infinitemonkeylab.com

This fairly accessible article by Peter Doyle contains the maths necessary to calculate the Monkey number in terms of the transition matrix of the markov chain associated with the Rubik's cube : https://arxiv.org/abs/0909.2636 (see in particular Proposition 3). 

That the mean recurrence (or return) time is equal to the number of configurations of a Rubik's cube is a corollary of some basic results in the theory of stochastic processes. I came across this insight for the first time in an answer by TonyK to the following question on stackexchange: https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/1608168/random-solving-of-a-rubik-cube

Here are the World Cubing Association rules on scrambling twisty puzzles for competitions:
https://www.worldcubeassociation.org/regulations/#4

Here is a link to a video which shows the scrambling program tnoodle in action: https://github.com/thewca/tnoodle/pull/236 

Notes on implementing the 2x2x2 experiments: As with counting configurations of the 2x2x2, we fixed one corner cubie and twisted the three faces not containing this corner. In this video I only report on the most interesting aspects of Erich and my playing around with this circle of problem. We tried lots of other things. Happy to discuss in the comments :)

Many thanks to Jeremy Fleischman and Lucas Garron for their help with understanding how the World Cubing Association creates scrambles of twisty puzzles for cubing competitions. Thank you to Erich for programming all those virtual cubing monkeys. And, as usual, thank you to Marty for nitpicking early drafts of the script and to Danil for his Russian support.

So you all know the golden (ratio) spiral. But did you know that not only the golden ratio but really every number has such a spiral associated with it? And that this spiral provides key insights into the nature of a number. Featuring more proofs by contradiction by infinite descent (my  current obsession), infinite continued fractions, etc.

I've got some good news and some bad news for you. The bad news is that Euler's identity e to the i pi = -1 is not really Euler's identity. The good news is that Euler really did discover zillions of fantastic identities. This video is about the one that made him famous pretty much overnight: pi squared over 6 = the infinite sum of the reciprocals of the square natural numbers. This video is about Euler's  ingenious original argument which apart from this superfamous identity allowed him to evaluate the precise values of the zeta function at all even numbers (amongst many other things :)

I am a huge fan of Euler’s and had been wanting to to make this video for a long time. Pretty nice how it did come together I think. One of the things I like best about making these videos is how much I end up learning myself. In this particular instance the highlights were actually calculating those other sums I mention myself using Euler’s idea (the Riemann Zeta function evaluated at even numbers) as well as learning about this alternate way to derive the Leibniz formula using the zeros of 1-sin(x). Oh, and one more thing. Euler’s idea of writing sin(x) in terms of its zeros may seem a bit crazy, but there is actually a theorem that tells us exactly what is possible in this respect. It’s called the Weierstrass factorization theorem. 

Good references are the following works by Euler: http://www.17centurymaths.com/contents/introductiontoanalysisvol1.htm

Get ready for some brand new and very pretty visual proofs of the fact that root 2, root 3, root 5 and root 6 are irrational numbers. 

Root 2 being irrational also translates into the fact that the equation  x^2+x^2=y^2 has no solutions in positive integers, root 3 being irrational translates into the fact that the equation  x^2+x^2+x^2=y^2 has no solutions in positive integers, etc. 

What I find very attractive about these proofs is that the destructive core of these proofs by contradiction lead a second secret constructive life, giving birth to infinitely many nearest miss solutions of our impossible equations like for example 15^2+15^2+15^2=26^2-1.

Here is the paper by Steven J. Miller and David Montague which features the basic root 3 and pentagonal root 5 choreographies.
https://arxiv.org/abs/0909.4913

Footnotes: 
-our nearest miss solutions like, for example, 
15^2+15^2+15^2=26^2-1
correspond to the solutions of the equation y^2 - n x^2 = 1 with n=2, 3, 5 and 6. This is the famous Pell's equation, which happens to have solutions for all integers n that are not squares. 
-there is also a second type of nearest miss solutions like 
4^2+4^2+4^2=7^2+1 (a plus instead of a minus at the end). Starting with one of these our choreographies also generate all other such nearest misses. 
-the original Tennenbaum square choreography and the first puzzle root three choreography generate both types of nearest misses from any nearest miss solution.
-The close approximations to the various roots corresponding to our nearest miss solutions are partial fractions of the continued fraction expansion of the roots.
-lots more things to be said here but we are getting close to the word limit for descriptions and so I better stop :)

Thank you very much to Marty for all his nitpicking of the script for this video and Danil for his ongoing Russian support.

This video is about Fermat's last theorem and Euler's conjecture,  a vast but not very well-known generalisation of this super theorem. Featuring guest appearances by Homer Simpson and the legendary supercomputer CDC6600. The video splits into a fairly easygoing first part and a hardcore second part which is dedicated to presenting my take on the simplest proof of the simplest case of Fermat's last theorem: A^4 +B^4=C^4 has no solution in positive integers A, B, C. 

The proof in question is taken from the book Lectures on elliptic curves by J.W.S. Cassels (pages 55 and 56). Here is a scan of the relevant bits: http://www.qedcat.com/misc/cassels_proof.pdf  This writeup of the proof actually contains a few little typos, can you find them? In the video I attribute the proof to John Cassels the author of this book because I've never seen it anywhere else. It's certainly not Fermat's proof as one may be led to believe reading Cassel's writeup of this proof.
The Wiki page on Euler's conjecture contains a good summary of the known results and a good list of references: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euler%27s_sum_of_powers_conjecture
There is one aspect of this conjecture that I did not go into in the video. The conjecture says that for n greater than 2 at least n nth positive integer powers are necessary to make another nth integer power. On the other hand, it is not known whether for every such n there is an example of n nth powers summing to another nth power. In fact, even my example of a sum of five 5th powers summing to another 5th power in the video was not known to Euler. Anyway, the wiki page also has a summary of what's known in this respect. 

Today's t-shirt should be easy to find, just google what it says on the t-shirt.

Thank you very much to Danil for his continuing Russian translation support, Marty for his very thorough nitpicking of the script and all this help with getting the explanations just right and Michael for his help with filming and editing.

In the last video of 2017 I showed you Lambert’s long but easy-to-motivate 1761 proof that pi is irrational. For today’s video Marty and I have tried to streamline an ingenious proof due to the famous French mathematician Charles Hermite into the hopefully simplest and shortest completely self-contained proof of the irrationality of pi. There are a few other versions of this proof floating around and we’ve incorporated the best ideas from these versions into what I’ll show you today; I’ll list some of these other versions below. I also talk about the problem of pi + e and pi x e being irrational at the end of the video, really nice stuff. 

Articles to check out: 
Ivan Niven’s simple proof (we essentially use his sequence of integers)  https://projecteuclid.org/euclid.bams/1183510788

A really nice article by Li Zhou http://arxiv.org/abs/0911.1929. Among many other things this article, has an introductory section on the origins of the strange integral at the core of the proof that I am presenting in this video. 

Another article by Li Zhou http://arxiv.org/abs/0911.1933. (the 6 line proof of Theorem 2 is essentially what I am presenting in this video). 

All these articles are great, but I think the one article that deserves most credit for having brought Hermite’s beautiful proof to the attention of the wider mathematical community is this article by Jan Stefvens: Zur Irrationalität von pi, Mitt. Math. Ges. Hamburg 18 (1999), 151-158. This one also has a very nice account of Lambert’s and Niven’s proofs.

In the video I mention that another version of this proof made an appearance in the toughest Australian maths exam in 2003; here is the link to this exam

And so I think it’s time to have another serious go at setting the record straight by having a really close look at the bizarre calculation at the center of the Numberphile video, to state clearly what is wrong with it, how to fix it, and how to reconnect it to the genuine math that the Numberphile professors had in mind originally. 

This is my second attempt at doing this topic justice. This video is partly in response to feedback that I got on my first video. What a lot of you were interested in were more details about the analytic continuation business and the strange Numberphile/Ramanujan calculations. Responding to these requests, in this video I am taking a very different approach from the first video and really go all out and don't hold back in any respect. The result is a video that is a crazy 41.44 (almost 42 :) minutes long.     

Lots of amazing maths to look forward to: non-standard summation methods for divergent series, the eta function a very well-behaved sister of the zeta function, the gist of analytic continuation in simple words, etc.

Here is a link to Ramanujan’s notebook that contains his Numberphile-like 1+2+3+… = -1/12 calculation. http://www.imsc.res.in/~rao/ramanujan/NoteBooks/NoteBook1/chapterVIII/page3.htm
This notebook entry was also one of the starting points of my last video on this topic: https://youtu.be/jcKRGpMiVTw

Other good videos that deal with this strange “identity” include the following: 
https://youtu.be/0Oazb7IWzbA (a Numberphile video featuring the mathematician Edward Frenkel who is also talking about the connection between the Riemann Zeta function and Ramanujan's crazy identity.) 
https://youtu.be/sD0NjbwqlYw (a nice 3Blue1Brown video about visualizing the analytic continuation of the Riemann Zeta function).

If you know some calculus and want to read up on all this, beyond what is readily available via the relevant Wiki pages and other internet resources, I recommend you read the last chapter of the book by Konrad Knopp, Theory and applications of infinite series, Dover books, 1990 (actually if you know German, read the extended version of this chapter in the 1924 (2nd) edition of the book ""Theorie und Anwendung der unendlichen Reihen"". The Dover book is a translation of the 4th German edition. The 5th German edition from 1964 can be found here: https://gdz.sub.uni-goettingen.de/id/PPN378970429). 

People usually recommend Hardy's book, Divergent series, but I'd say only look at this after you've looked at Knopp's book which I find a lot more accessible. Having said that, Hardy's book does have quite a bit of detail on how Ramanujan summation applies to the Zeta function; see chapters 13.10. and 13.17.

This video is my best shot at animating and explaining my favourite proof that pi is irrational.  It is due to the Swiss mathematician Johann Lambert who published it over 250 years ago. 

The original write-up by Lambert is 58 pages long and definitely not for the faint of heart (http://www.kuttaka.org/~JHL/L1768b.pdf).  On the other hand, among all the proofs of the irrationality of pi, Lambert's proof is probably the most ""natural"" one, the one that's easiest to motivate and explain, and one that's ideally suited for the sort of animations that I do. 

Anyway it's been an absolute killer to put this video together and overall this is probably the most ambitious topic I've tackled so far. I really hope that a lot of you will get something out of it. If you do please let me know :) Also, as usual, please consider contributing subtitles in your native language (English and Russian are under control, but everything else goes). 

One of the best short versions of Lambert's proof is contained in the book Autour du nombre pi by Jean-Pierre Lafon and Pierre Eymard. In particular, in it the authors calculate an explicit formula for the n-th partial fraction of Lambert's tan x formula; here is a scan with some highlighting by me: http://www.qedcat.com/misc/chopped.png
Have a close look and you'll see that as n goes to infinity all the highlighted terms approach 1. What's left are the Maclaurin series for sin x on top and that for cos x at the bottom and this then goes a long way towards showing that those partial fractions really tend to tan x.

There is a good summary of other proofs for the irrationality of pi on this wiki page: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proof_that_π_is_irrational

It is very surprising that it took so long for someone to notice this fundamental property of as basic a shape as a cube. It is also very surprising that even today hardly anybody has heard about it. Featuring lots of fancy cube shadows, Prince Rupert's paradoxical cube and a twisty puzzle that looks like a Skewb but isn't, among many other things. 

Here is the original paper that introduced the shadow theorem to the world: Volumes of Projections of unit Cubes, Peter McMullen, Bull London Math. Soc. (1984) 16: 278-280.

In the second part of the video we'll explore higher-dimensional counterparts of the shadow theorem which then also put in context the two paradoxical warm-up exercises that I used as a hook for the first video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xe-f4gokRBs

"c9nUAXUSuII","Liouville's number, the easiest transcendental and its clones (corrected reupload)","Liouville's number, the easiest transcendental and its clones (corrected reupload)","This is a corrected re-upload of a video from a couple of weeks ago. The original version contained one too many shortcut that I really should not have taken. Although only two viewers stumbled across this mess-up it really bothered me, and so here is the corrected version of the video, hopefully free of any more reupload-worthy mistakes. For those of you who already watched the previous version of this video, see whether you can figure out what required fixing :) 

This video is all about convincing you that Liouville's number is really a transcendental number. I am presenting a proof for this fact that you won't find in any textbook and I am keeping my fingers crossed that people will agree that this is the most accessible proof of the transcendence of any specific number. Also part of this video is a nice way to create a clone of the real numbers using the Liouville's number as a template. This clone is a seriously paradoxical subset of the reals: it consists entirely of transcendental numbers (with one exception), just like the reals it  is uncountably infinite AND of it is of measure 0, that is, it is hidden so well within the reals that in a sense it not even there. 

The measure 0 extra video is at https://youtu.be/4ga58IP1iJU on Mathologer 2.

Liouville's original paper is here:
Liouville, J. ""Sur des classes très-étendues de quantités dont la valeur n'est ni algébrique, ni même réductible à des irrationelles algébriques."" J. Math. pures appl. 16, 133-142, 1851.
http://sites.mathdoc.fr/JMPA/PDF/JMPA_1851_1_16_A5_0.pdf
And if you are interested in having a look at this proof as it also appears in all the textbooks here is one possible reference:
http://people.math.sc.edu/filaseta/gradcourses/Math785/Math785Notes5.pdf
The proof that I am showing you in this video was inspired by Conway and Guy's take on the subject in their ""Book of numbers"". In particular, if you are familiar with this book you'll also recognise the 6th degree polynomial that I am using as one of the examples.

Find out how Georg Cantor's infinities can be used in a very simple and off the beaten track way to pinpoint a transcendental number and to show that it is really transcendental. Also find out why there are a lot more transcendental numbers than numbers that we usually think of as numbers, and this despite the fact that it is super tough to show the transcendence of any number of interest such as pi or e. Also featuring an animated introduction to countable and uncountable infinities, Joseph Liouville's ocean of zeros constant, and much more.

Here is a link to one of Georg Cantor's first papers on his theory of infinite sets. Interestingly it deals with the construction of transcendental numbers!

The story is broken up into three very tricky puzzles. Challenge yourself to figure them out before the Mathologer reveals his own solutions. Featuring Batman, the controversial Axiom of Choice and a guest appearance by the Banach-Tarski paradox. 

The pictures that I used for the Banach-Tarski ball splitting action were grabbed off the brilliant VSauce's video on the Banach-Tarski paradox (https://youtu.be/s86-Z-CbaHA) I mainly did this for easy reference since most people here will have seen this video and in this way would be able to connect easily with what I am talking about here. 
I also mention that those sets that get pushed around in the Banach-Tarski paradox are constructed using the Axiom of Choice. Vsauce actually does not mention this although this is really a big deal as far as mathematics is concerned (understandable though since his video was already very long).  Here is a link to the spot in the Vsauce video where the Axiom of Choice is envoked (although you have to have a really close look to see how :)   https://youtu.be/s86-Z-CbaHA?t=14m2s

There is a very nice TEDed video about the finite version of the last of our puzzles: https://youtu.be/N5vJSNXPEwA  The solutions to both the infinite and the finite version are closely related.

Some footnotes (for experts):
1. In a scrambled normal Rubik's Cube the permutations of edges and corners will always have the same parity, that is, either both will be odd or both even.  The four algorithms that I start with (cycling 3 edges, cycling 3 corners, flipping 2 edges, twisting 2 corners) correspond to even permutations of both the edges and the corners. This means that you won't be able to solve the normal Rubik's cube by just using these algorithms if the parity of the edge (and corner) permutation is odd. However, on closer inspection it turns out that you can do so if that parity is even. And, if it is odd, just executing one quarter turn will turn these odd permutations into even permutations which can then be unscrambled just using those for algorithms.
2. The face piece and edge piece permutations of the 4D Rubik's cube are connected in a similar way, that is, either both permutations are odd or both are even. This means that if you get stuck solving the face hypercubies just using the algorithms that I talk about in the video (which all correspond to even permutations of those pieces), just execute a suitable twist and you are on your way. Once the face hypercubies are solved just using our algorithms you can solve the edge hypercubies.  The corner piece permutation is always even and can always be solved just using the algorithms derived in the video.","2016-06-17 22:05:53","en",1092,527298,7173,"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/yhPH1369OWc/default.jpg",1035,"Cracking the 4D Rubik's Cube with simple 3D tricks","UC1_uAIS3r8Vu6JjXWvastJg","27"

Find out about how these identities come up in Ramanujan's work, the role of ""just do it"" in math, the rules for adding infinite sums on Earth and other worlds, and what all this has to do with the mathematical super star the Riemann Zeta function.

If you want to watch some other videos that deal with these strange identities I recommend the following:

https://youtu.be/8hgeIDY7We4 (James Grime's video (singingbanana & Numberphile) which aims at making sense of the  formula at the heart of Ramanujan summation which I only flash briefly in the last part of the video.)
https://youtu.be/XFDM1ip5HdU (a very nice 3Blue1Brown video that makes sense of the identity 1+2+4+8+ ... = –1 in a way that is totally different from the one I am talking about in this video.)

This week’s video is in response to a large number of you and my students at university asking me for my take on the whole 1+2+3+... =-1/12 business. Initially, the plan was to come up with one of my usual 15 minute long videos. However, after several unsuccessful attempts at not exceeding the magic Mathologer time limit, I realised that any “short” video like this would just be a clone of one of those wrong/misleading accounts of this topic that YouTube is full of. So, rather than just give up completely on this project I decided to do what you should never do if you actually want people to watch your videos, namely simply go for it and not look at the clock. The result – a video that is an insane 35 minutes long in which I say all the things that I think need to be said and can be said only using elementary math to (just barely) do this amazing topic justice.

Enjoy!

P.S.: If you know calculus and want to read up on all this some more, beyond what is readily available via the relevant Wiki pages and other internet resources, I recommend you read the last chapter of the book by Konrad Knopp, Theory and applications of infinite series, Dover books, 1990 (actually if you know German, read the extended version of this chapter in the  original 1924 edition of the book). People usually recommend Hardy's book, Divergent series, but I'd say only look at this after you've looked at Knopp's book which I find a lot more accessible. The Hardy who wrote this book is the Hardy who I mention at the beginning of the video! Having said that, Hardy's book does have quite a bit of detail on how Ramanujan summation applies to the Zeta function; see chapters 13.10. and 13.17.","2016-04-22 21:08:24","en",2071,3503692,55028,"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/jcKRGpMiVTw/default.jpg",6111,"Ramanujan: Making sense of 1+2+3+... = -1/12 and Co.","UC1_uAIS3r8Vu6JjXWvastJg","27"

And for those of you who enjoy some mathematical challenges here is your homework assignment on Euler's identity:
1. How much money does Homer have after Pi years if interest is compounded continuously?
2. How much money does Homer have after an imaginary Pi number of years?
3. As we've seen when you let m go to infinity the function (1+x/m)^m turns into the exponential function. In fact, it turns into the infinite series expansion of the exponential function that we used in our previous video. Can you explain why?
4. Can you explain the e to pi i paradox that we've captured in this video on Mathologer 2: https://youtu.be/Sx5_QGdFmq4.

The good old times tables lead a very exciting secret life involving the infamous Mandelbrot set, the ubiquitous cardioid and a myriad of hidden beautiful patterns. Time for the Mathologer to go on a serious fact-finding mission.

For those of you who’d like to play around a bit with the stunning times table diagrams that we discuss in this video, download the .cdf file http://www.qedcat.com/cardioid.cdf  and open it with the free cdf player which you can download from Wolfram Research (the people behind Wolfram Alpha and Mathematica). If you have access to Mathematica you can also open my .cdf file in Mathematica and play with the code.
 
For those of you who are looking for a bit of a challenge, ponder this:
1) Starting with the fact that the nephroid arises from parallel rays being reflected inside a cylindrical coffee cup, try to convince yourself that the 3 times table really does produce the nephroid (some really neat geometry at work here, very similar to the argument for the cardioid that I talk about at the end of the video). (Added 8 November 2015 check out the proof at http://www.qedcat.com/nephroid_proof.pdf )
2) Why do the diagrams for all the times tables have a horizontal mirror symmetry?
3) Try to explain the pretty patterns corresponding to the 51 and 99 times tables modulo 200 that I display in the video (around the 9:30 mark).
4) (For those of you with a very strong math background) Try to figure out why the cardioid shows up in the Mandelbrot set.

The discovery of the stunning patterns that I discuss in this video is due to the mathematician Simon Plouffe. Check out this article  http://tinyurl.com/o2hbtsa and his website http://plouffe.fr for other stunning visualisations using modular arithmetic.

During this time, the Pech Merle cave was used as a place of refuge by prehistoric peoples, as the area had a distinctly arctic, frigid climate, with harsh winters. It is here that Prof Roberts is delighted to view first-hand the magnificent artistic expressions of these early hunter-gatherers.

By 950 CE, the Mayan civilisation had collapsed, but no one knows for certain how it happened, or indeed how many people died. Archaeologists have differing theories, including starvation, drought, climate change, disease, and warfare. Now, science can give us extra insight into some of the factors behind their demise. Could 1,200 year old ice hold clues to this ancient mystery?

The late great Terry Jones investigates the truth of the Roman Games, uncovering what it took to be a gladiator and the showmanship behind the Games’ violent legacy.

For 750 years, the local colosseum was the prime destination for action and excitement. What began as human sacrifice during funeral rites for wealthy families resulted in a violent, bloody battle staged in front of 50,000 fans. Gladiators were slaves, but the archaeological remains at Pompeii and the Roman Colosseum reveal that they were held in the same esteem as modern day sports stars - a reputation that required a great degree of stylistic ‘panache’ in their fighting.

But, with few historical records from the time, Professor Fekri Hassan and other historians have been able to build a greater sense of the period through the hieroglyphics inscribed in tombs. These important inscriptions have allowed us to build a better understanding as to what occurred during this epic period of history.

This clip is from Ancient Apocalypse (2001). This series can be watched in the UK on BBC iPlayer: https://www.bbc.co.uk/iplayer/episodes/b01gm6jh/ancient-apocalypse

You can play with a simulation of this model here: https://vilas.us/simulations/liquidvapor/

Home page: https://www.3blue1brown.com

Notes from Vilas:
1) This open problem is to prove the ergodicity of the deterministic dynamical systems that are used to model the molecule-level physics. A good example of such a dynamical system is the box with particles evolving according to Newton's laws with elastic collisions, like in the video.

2) This video assumes that all probability distributions are discrete, which is the case in the simulations. But one can also set up this formalism for systems with continuous state spaces. Again, a good example is particles in a box, which are not restricted to a lattice, which is only used for visualization purposes in this video.

3) Strictly speaking, these ""derivatives"" don't make sense since in our simulations the energy can only take on a discrete set of values. But a derivative is the right way to think about this, and is the correct notion in a limiting sense.

4) The factor of -T in the definition of the chemical potential is sort of a historical leftover, but including it has the convenient side effect of allowing the same Boltzmann formula to hold, with an energy function that depends on the chemical potential as well. It should also be noted that temperature must equalize in any situation where the chemical potential equalizes, since it is impossible for systems to exchange molecules without also exchanging energy.

5) This algorithm, where we only choose one pixel at a time, is called Glauber dynamics. There are multiple ways to parallelize it, but the method chosen in this video is to only update each pixel with a low probability at each call of the compute shader, to avoid (frequently) updating two neighboring pixels simultaneously. One could also alternate between updating the even or odd pixels at each step.

6) By ""zooming out,"" what is meant, technically, is a renormalization operation whereby each 3x3 grid of pixels is replaced by just one pixel, which has a molecule exactly when 5 or more of the pixels in the 3x3 grid have molecules. But that is somewhat tough to simulate as the size has to increase by 9 at each step, so this video cheats a bit by just zooming out on a large simulation.

7) The ""interesting behavior"" referenced here is the fact that the interface between the up and down sections of the picture can be rescaled (as the size of the model goes to infinity) in a way that yields a universal random curve called Schramm-Loewner evolution. This family of random curves shows up in many seemingly-unrelated places in statistical mechanics and probability.

Technical Notes
The noise videos in the opening have been passed through a VAE (actually, diffusion process happens in a compressed “latent” space), which acts very much like a video compressor - this is why the noise videos don’t look like pure salt and pepper.

6:15 CLIP: Although directly minimizing cosine similarity would push our vectors 180 degrees apart on a single batch, overall in practice, we need CLIP to maximize the uniformity of concepts over the hypersphere it's operating on. For this reason, we animated these vectors as orthogonal-ish. See: https://proceedings.mlr.press/v119/wang20k/wang20k.pdf

Per Chenyang Yuan: at 10:15, the blurry image that results when removing random noise in DDPM is probably due to a mismatch in noise levels when calling the denoiser. When the denoiser is called on x_{t-1} during DDPM sampling, it is expected to have a certain noise level (let's call it sigma_{t-1}). If you generate x_{t-1} from x_t without adding noise, then the noise present in x_{t-1} is always smaller than sigma_{t-1}. This causes the denoiser to remove too much noise, thus pointing towards the mean of the dataset. 

The text conditioning input to stable diffusion is not the 512-dim text embedding vector, but the output of the layer before that, [with dimension 77x512](https://stackoverflow.com/a/79243065)

For the vectors at 31:40 - Some implementations use f(x, t, cat) + alpha(f(x, t, cat) - f(x, t)), and some that do f(x, t) + alpha(f(x, t, cat) - f(x, t)), where an alpha value of 1 corresponds to no guidance. I chose the second format here to keep things simpler.

At 30:30, the unconditional t=1 vector field looks a bit different from what it did at the 17:15 mark. This is the result of different models trained for different parts of the video, and likely a result of different random initializations.

Build a GPT from scratch, by Andrej Karpathy

If you want a conceptual understanding of language models from the ground up, @vcubingx just started a short series of videos on the topic:
https://youtu.be/1il-s4mgNdI?si=XaVxj6bsdy3VkgEX

If you're interested in the herculean task of interpreting what these large networks might actually be doing, the Transformer Circuits posts by Anthropic are great. In particular, it was only after reading one of these that I started thinking of the combination of the value and output matrices as being a combined low-rank map from the embedding space to itself, which, at least in my mind, made things much clearer than other sources.

Thanks to Paul Dancstep for several animations, such as the powers of 10 zoom out and the simulations of shadows on the moon.

Terry has kindly cataloged many of the added nuances, including a few corrections, in this post:

As an additional one, the portrait shown for Kepler, despite being somewhat widespread, actually turns out not to be Kepler. See this article by  Václav Pavlík https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021PhT....74i..10S/abstract

Also,  although the Earth is about 4 times as wide as the Moon, as it happens, you would not see this with the lunar eclipse composites, since the umbra of Earth's shadow from the sun is sufficiently smaller than the Earth out where the Moon is.

This argument was originally by Herbert Vaughan, appearing for examples in this issue of the Topology Proceedings.
https://topology.nipissingu.ca/tp/reprints/v06/tp06107.pdf

The on-screen argument for why all closed non-orientable surfaces must intersect themselves in 3d is a slight variation on one I heard from Dan Asimov.

Thanks to Daniel Kim for sharing the first two puzzles with me. He mentioned the earliest reference he knows for the tile puzzles is David and Tomei's AMM article titled ""The problem of Calissons.""

The idea to include the tetrahedron volume example was based on a conversation with Po Shen Lo about these puzzles, during which he mentioned the case of one dimension lower.

I received the cone correction to the proof of Monge's theorem from Akos Zahorsky via email. Also, the Bulgarian team leader Velian Velikov brought up the same argument, and just shot me a message saying ""I came across it in a book I found online titled 'Mathematical Puzzles' by Peter Winkler. There, it is attributed to Nathan Bowler""

I referenced quaternions at the end, and if you're curious to learn more, here are a few options.

This is a nice talk targetted at game developers:
https://youtu.be/en2QcehKJd8

This video walks through concretely what the computation is for using quaternions to compute 3d rotations: 
https://youtu.be/-zsnHbQyRnc

My own video on the topic is mainly focused on understanding what they do up in four dimensions, which is not strictly necessary for using them, but for math nerds like me may be satisfying:
https://youtu.be/d4EgbgTm0Bg

Also, one of the coolest projects I've ever done was a collaboration with Ben Eater to make interactive videos based on that topic:

Hologram credits:
The Microscope is by Walter Spierings, 1984
Donations Hologram by Cherry Optical Holography
Lucy in a Tin Hat is by Patrick Keown Boyd, 1988
The Star Wars-themed Direct-Write Digital Holograms were produced by Zebra Imaging.
The 'Shakespeare' embossed animated integral hologram was made by Applied Holographics.

Walter Spierings, who did the microscope, is from Dutch Holographic Laboratory. He wanted me to let you know that anyone should feel free to approach them when it comes to producing holograms, they do a lot of innovative things with the medium: www.holoprint.com 

Thanks to everyone who helped with this project:
Paul Dancstep, for help writing, and for all the 3d modeling
Craig Newswanger and Sally Weber, for making the central hologram shown
Kurt Bruns, for the artwork of Dennis Gabor
Phoebe Tooke, Wayne Grim, and Rick Danielson, for filming at the exploratorium
Quinn Brodsky and Mithuna Yoganathan, for footage of lasers through diffraction gratings
Vince Rubinetti, for writing the music
Cliff Stoll for the Klein Bottle

Small correction: After the algebra in the end, I say ""We don't even make assumptions about R"", but that's not quite true. To treat |R^2| as some scaling factor in the expression |R^2| * O, it matters that the amplitude of R is approximately constant around a given point.

If you want a conceptual understanding of language models from the ground up, @vcubingx just started a short series of videos on the topic:
https://youtu.be/1il-s4mgNdI?si=XaVxj6bsdy3VkgEX

If you're interested in the herculean task of interpreting what these large networks might actually be doing, the Transformer Circuits posts by Anthropic are great. In particular, it was only after reading one of these that I started thinking of the combination of the value and output matrices as being a combined low-rank map from the embedding space to itself, which, at least in my mind, made things much clearer than other sources.

Veritasium video on FFTs
https://youtu.be/nmgFG7PUHfo

A small correction for the integer multiplication algorithm mentioned at the end. A “straightforward” application of FFT results in a runtime of O(N * log(n) log(log(n)) ). That log(log(n)) term is tiny, but it is only recently in 2019, Harvey and van der Hoeven found an algorithm that removed that log(log(n)) term.

Another small correction at 17:00. I describe O(N^2) as meaning ""the number of operations needed scales with N^2"". However, this is technically what Theta(N^2) would mean. O(N^2) would mean that the number of operations needed is at most constant times N^2, in particular, it includes algorithms whose runtimes don't actually have any N^2 term, but which are bounded by it. The distinction doesn't matter in this case, since there is an explicit N^2 term.

The book by my friend Matt Cook about paradoxes mentioned at the end:
https://amzn.to/3aBrEzg

On the topic, I can't help also mentioning another paradox book I'm rather fond of by Bunch:
https://amzn.to/3mBDSKE

Another video on Bayes' theorem:
https://youtu.be/HZGCoVF3YvM

*As mentioned in the on-screen note at the end, while the terms ""Bayes Factor"" and ""Likelihood Ratio"" refer to the same ratio in this setting, where Bayes rule is used on the probability of an event with only two possible outcomes (you either have the disease or you don't), they do take on divergent meanings in more general contexts.  Namely, if you have a continuous parameter you are trying to estimate, the two terms reflect two alternate approaches you can use in comparing hypotheses.  In fact, some people take the phrase ""Bayes factor"" to _specifically_ refer to its use in this more continuous context.

If you want more details, Wikipedia actually has a really nice example discussing the difference:
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bayes_factor#Example

This post has some nice discussion of the distinction:
https://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/27345/likelihood-ratio-vs-bayes-factor

Mistakes:
At 1:06:20, when changing r to equal 0.69*i, I said ""this is what we might think of as (2i)^x"", but that is not correct.  It's what we'd think of as [Exp(ln(2)*i)]^x for whatever complex number Exp(ln(2)*i) is.

Beautiful pictorial summary by @ThuyNganVu:
https://twitter.com/ThuyNganVu/status/1259288683489849344

Errors:
At minute 16, the sum should be written with a ""..."" to indicate going to infinity.
At minute 38, the exponent should have 1/(2s^2) instead of 1/s^2 for s to represent standard deviation.
At minute 54, an equal sign was mistakenly used in taking the derivative of x^3 / 3!.
At the end, it should be pointed out that the alternating series with x^n terms only converges for values of x between -1 and 1, so the values one can't be considered proven with values of x outside that range.  Everything with the argument here is fine, as it only deals with the convergent input, but that fact should still be mentioned.

Mistakes:
In the off-handed remarks on quaternions, I mentioned rotation in 4d would require 10 degrees of freedom.  That's wrong, what I should have said was it requires 6 degrees of freedom, and rotation in 5D is what requires 10 degrees of freedom.

Not on the ""homework"" to show that exp(x + y) = exp(x) * exp(y). This gets a little more intricate if you start asking seriously about whether the series really converge, what they converge to, and how exactly you define a product with infinitely many terms. For anyone curious about the technical details, what you would want to show is that the Cauchy Product of the series for exp(x) and exp(y) converges to the product of the values exp(x) and exp(y) for any particular x and y. That requires the Merten's Theorem.

Errors:
- On the first sketch of a complex plane, there is a ""2i"" written instead of ""-2i"".
- At the end, in writing the angle sum identity, the last term should be sin(beta) instead of sin(alpha).
- During Q9, the terms in parentheses should include an i, (1/2 + sqrt(3)/2 i)

Curious about measure theory?  This does require some background in real analysis, but if you want to dig in, here is a textbook by the always-great Terence Tao.
https://terrytao.files.wordpress.com/2012/12/gsm-126-tao5-measure-book.pdf

Also, for the real analysis buffs among you, there was one statement I made in this video that is a rather nice puzzle.  Namely, if the probabilities for each value in a given range (of the real number line) are all non-zero, no matter how small, their sum will be infinite.  This isn't immediately obvious, given that you can have convergent sums of countable infinitely many values, but if you're up for it see if you can prove that the sum of any uncountable infinite collection of positive values must blow up to infinity.

Code for this video:
https://github.com/3b1b/videos/blob/master/_2020/sir.py

Honestly, given that the code for that video is meant for demo purposes, and not meant to reflect the true data of COVID-19, if you want to apply these ideas to the current situation I'd recommend looking for more professional epidemiological modeling tools that are less centered around animations and pedagogy and more focused on accurate predictions.  For example, the Institute for Disease Modeling has a lot of models free for people to look at and play with.

Excellent visualization of this kind of growth from Minutephysics and Aatish Bhatia:
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54XLXg4fYsc

Data source: https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/coronavirus-cases/#case-tot-outchina

Some have (quite rightfully) commented on how you shouldn't look at the R^2 of linear regressions on cumulative data since even if the changes from one day to the next are completely random, the totals they add up to wouldn't be independent of each other.  Since the derivative of an exponential should also be an exponential, we could instead run the same test on the logarithms of the differences from day to day, which in this case gives R^2 = 0.91.

While this video uses COVID-19 as a motivating example, the main goal is simply a math lesson on exponentials and logistic curves.  If you're looking for a video more focused on COVID-19 itself, I'd recommend taking a look at this one from Osmosis: https://youtu.be/cFB_C2ieW5I

7:20 - Why the galactic spirals
9:30 - Euler’s totient function
10:28 - The larger scale
14:45 - Dirichlet’s theorem
20:26 - Why care?

Corrections:
18:30: In the video, I say that Dirichlet showed that the primes are equally distributed among allowable residue classes, but this is not historically accurate.  (By ""allowable"", here, I mean a residue class whose elements are coprime to the modulus, as described in the video).  What he actually showed is that the sum of the reciprocals of all primes in a given allowable residue class diverges, which proves that there are infinitely many primes in such a sequence.

Dirichlet observed this equal distribution numerically and noted this in his paper, but it wasn't until decades later that this fact was properly proved, as it required building on some of the work of Riemann in his famous 1859 paper.  If I'm not mistaken, I think it wasn't until Vallée Poussin in (1899), with a version of the prime number theorem for residue classes like this, but I could be wrong there.

In many ways, this was a very silly error for me to have let through.  It is true that this result was proven with heavy use of complex analysis, and in fact, it's in a complex analysis lecture that I remember first learning about it.  But of course, this would have to have happened after Dirichlet because it would have to have happened after Riemann!

My apologies for the mistake.  If you notice factual errors in videos that are not already mentioned in the video's description or pinned comment, don't hesitate to let me know.

Not familiar with the calculus referenced in this video?  Try taking a look at this one:

Another perspective on this formula, from Mathologer:

Another perspective from this channel:
https://youtu.be/mvmuCPvRoWQ

And yet another from the blog Better Explained:
https://betterexplained.com/articles/intuitive-understanding-of-eulers-formula/

I'm not sure where the perspective shown in this video originates.  I do know you can find it in Tristan Needham's excellent book ""Visual Complex Analysis"", but if anyone has a sense of the first occurrence of this intuition do feel free to share.  It's simple and natural enough, though, that it's probably a view which has been independently thought up many times over.

If anyone asks, I purposefully leave at least one typo in each video, like a Navajo rug with a deliberate imperfection as an artistic statement about the nature of life ;)

And to continue my unabashed Strogatz fanboyism, I should also mention that his textbook on nonlinear dynamics and chaos was also a meaningful motivator to do this series, as you'll hopefully see with the topics we build to.

New to this channel?  It's all about teaching math visually.  Take a look and see if there's anything you'd like to learn.

NY Times blog post about this problem:
https://wordplay.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/03/10/pi/

The original paper by Gregory Galperin:
https://www.maths.tcd.ie/~lebed/Galperin.%20Playing%20pool%20with%20pi.pdf

Evidently, Numberphile also described this problem (I had not known):
https://youtu.be/abv4Fz7oNr0
You'll notice that video has an added factor of 16 throughout, which is not here.  That's because they're only counting the collisions between blocks (well, balls in their case), and they're only counting to the point where the big block starts moving the other way.

Discussion on Reddit: https://www.reddit.com/r/3Blue1Brown/comments/a2gqo0/but_why_is_a_spheres_surface_area_four_times_its/

The first proof goes back to Greek times, due to Archimedes, who was charmed by the fact that a sphere has 2/3 the volume of a cylinder encompassing it, and 2/3 the surface area as well (if you consider the caps).  Check out this video for another beautiful animation of that first proof:

These animations are largely made using manim, a scrappy open-source python library:  https://github.com/3b1b/manim

If you want to check it out, I feel compelled to warn you that it's not the most well-documented tool, and it has many other quirks you might expect in a library someone wrote with only their own use in mind.

Thanks to Dan Walsh for many great ideas, and thanks to Mike Hansen for many helpful conversations.

Error correction: I meant to describe Kolmogorov as a “20th-century mathematician” not “19th-century”.  Whoops!  I think during the narration I must have made the classic 1900s vs. 19th-century mix up.  Anyone aware of his work is more than aware of what century he lived in, which apparently applies to quite a few commenters.

And while we're here, the animation at 9:55 misleadingly has the vortex kind of speed up during the transition, which it should not do.  Really, the velocity scales of eddies decrease for lower length scales.

If you want to dive into the relevant ideas required to make this proof more rigorous, the relevant search term is ""dominated convergence"".
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dominated_convergence_theorem

Here's a good blog post on the topic:
https://www.math3ma.com/blog/dominated-convergence-theorem

In the video, I referenced our own blog post expanding on this argument. Unfortunately, it managed to get lost during a website transition.

Another approach to this product by Johan Wästlund:
http://www.math.chalmers.se/~wastlund/monthly.pdf

With more from Donald Knuth building off this idea:

Even though we described how winding numbers can be used to solve 2d equations at a high level, it's worth pointing out that there are a few details missing for if you wanted to actually implement this.  For example, in order to determine how often to sample points, you'd want to have some bounds on the rate at which the direction of the output changes.  We will perhaps discuss this more in a follow-on video!

Check out Mathologer's video on the many cousins of the Pythagorean theorem:

Some of you may be concerned about the final step here where we said the circle approaches a line.  What about all the lighthouses on the far end?  Well, a more careful calculation will show that the contributions from those lights become more negligible.  In fact, the contributions from almost all lights become negligible.  For the ambitious among you, see this paper for full details.

More on Doppler radar:
Radar basics: https://www.eetimes.com/document.asp?doc_id=1278808

There's a key way in which the description I gave of the trade-off in Doppler radar differs from reality.  Since the speed of light is so drastically greater than the speed of things being detected, the Fourier representation for pulse echoes of different objects would almost certainly overlap unless it was played for a very long time.  In effect, this is what happens, since one does not send out a single pulse, but a whole bunch of evenly spaced pulses as some pulse repetition frequency (or PRF).  

This means the Fourier representation of all those pulses together can actually be quite sharp.  Assuming a large number of such pulses, it will look like several vertical lines spaced out by the PRF.  As long as the pulses are far enough apart that the echoes of multiple objects on the field from different targets don't overlap, it's not a problem for position determinations that the full sequence of pulses occupies such a long duration.  However, the trade-off now comes in choosing the right PRF.  See the above article for more information.

This video was supported by Amplify Partners.
For any early-stage ML startup founders, Amplify Partners would love to hear from you via 3blue1brown@amplifypartners.com

To learn more, I highly recommend the book by Michael Nielsen
http://neuralnetworksanddeeplearning.com/
The book walks through the code behind the example in these videos, which you can find here: 
https://github.com/mnielsen/neural-networks-and-deep-learning

MNIST database:
http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/

Also check out Chris Olah's blog: 
http://colah.github.io/
His post on Neural networks and topology is particular beautiful, but honestly all of the stuff there is great.

And if you like that, you'll *love* the publications at distill:
https://distill.pub/

For more videos, Welch Labs also has some great series on machine learning: 
https://youtu.be/i8D90DkCLhI
https://youtu.be/bxe2T-V8XRs

""But I've already voraciously consumed Nielsen's, Olah's and Welch's works"", I hear you say.  Well well, look at you then.  That being the case, I might recommend that you continue on with the book ""Deep Learning"" by Goodfellow, Bengio, and Courville.

Thanks to Lisha Li (@lishali88) for her contributions at the end, and for letting me pick her brain so much about the material.  Here are the articles she referenced at the end:

For those who want to learn more, I highly recommend the book by Michael Nielsen that introduces neural networks and deep learning: https://goo.gl/Zmczdy

There are two neat things about this book.  First, it's available for free, so consider joining me in making a donation to Nielsen if you get something out of it.  And second, it's centered around walking through some code and data, which you can download yourself, and which covers the same example that I introduced in this video.  Yay for active learning!

Huge thanks to my friend Evan Miyazono, both for encouraging me to do this project, and for helping me understand many things along the way.

This is a simple primer for how the math of quantum mechanics, specifically in the context of polarized light, relates to the math of classical waves, specifically classical electromagnetic waves.

I will say, if you *do* want to go off and learn the math of quantum mechanics, you just can never have too much linear algebra, so check out the series I did at https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLZHQObOWTQDPD3MizzM2xVFitgF8hE_ab

Mistakes: As several astute commenters have pointed out, the force arrow is pointing the wrong way at 2:18.  Thanks for the catch!

*Note on conventions:  Throughout this video, I use a single-headed right arrow to represent the horizontal direction.  The standard in quantum mechanics is actually to use double-headed arrows for describing polarization states, while single-headed arrows are typically reserved for the context of spin.

What's the difference?  Well, using a double-headed arrow to represent the horizontal direction emphasizes that in a quantum mechanical context, there's no distinction between left and right.  They each have the same measurable state: horizontal (e.g. they pass through horizontally oriented filters).  Once you're in QM, these kets are typically vectors in a more abstract space where vectors are not necessarily spatial directions but instead represent any kind of state.

Because of how I chose to motivate things with classical waves, where it makes sense for this arrow to represent a unit vector in the right direction, rather than the more abstract idea of a horizontal state vector, I chose to stick with the single-headed notation throughout, though this runs slightly against convention.

Several people have commented about how 2^256 would be the maximum number of attempts, not the average.  This depends on the thing being attempted.  If it's guessing a private key, you are correct, but for something like guessing which input to a hash function gives the desired output (as in bitcoin mining, for example), which is the kind of thing I had in mind here, 2^256 would indeed be the average number of attempts needed, at least for a true cryptographic hash function.  Think of rolling a die until you get a 6, how many rolls do you need to make, on average?

Note, to illustrate my point for the target audience of a new calculus student, I discussed a hypothetical speedometer that makes distance measurements over a very small time.  Interestingly, most actual speedometers in modern cars work by analyzing the induced current of a spinning magnet, which is in some sense the universe implementing the derivative.

These animations are largely made using manim, a scrappy open source Python library:  https://github.com/3b1b/manim

If you want to check it out, I feel compelled to warn you that it's not the most well-documented tool, and it has many other quirks you might expect in a library someone wrote with only their own use in mind.

If you want to contribute translated subtitles or to help review those that have already been made by others and need approval, you can click the gear icon in the video and go to subtitles/cc, then ""add subtitles/cc"".  I really appreciate those who do this, as it helps make the lessons accessible to more people.

There's a slight mistake at 13:33, where the angle should be arctan(1/2) = 26.565 degrees, not 30 degrees.  Arg!  If anyone asks, I was just...er...rounding to the nearest 10's.

One technical note: It's possible to have fractals with an integer dimension.  The example to have in mind is some *very* rough curve, which just so happens to achieve roughness level exactly 2.  Slightly rough might be around 1.1-dimension; quite rough could be 1.5; but a very rough curve could get up to 2.0 (or more).  A classic example of this is the boundary of the Mandelbrot set.  The Sierpinski pyramid also has dimension 2 (try computing it!).

The proper definition of a fractal, at least as Mandelbrot wrote it, is a shape whose ""Hausdorff dimension"" is greater than its ""topological dimension"".  Hausdorff dimension is similar to the box-counting one I showed in this video, in some sense counting using balls instead of boxes, and it coincides with box-counting dimension in many cases. But it's more general, at the cost of being a bit harder to describe.  

Topological dimension is something that's always an integer, wherein (loosely speaking) curve-ish things are 1-dimensional, surface-ish things are two-dimensional, etc.  For example, a Koch Curve has topological dimension 1, and Hausdorff dimension 1.262.  A rough surface might have topological dimension 2, but fractal dimension  2.3.  And if a curve with topological dimension 1 has a Hausdorff dimension that *happens* to be exactly 2, or 3, or 4, etc., it would be considered a fractal, even though it's fractal dimension is an integer.

See Mandelbrot's book ""The Fractal Geometry of Nature"" for the full details and more examples.

For those who want to learn more about complex exponentiation, here are a few resources:
- My video on the topic: http://youtu.be/mvmuCPvRoWQ
- Mathologer's: https://youtu.be/-dhHrg-KbJ0
- Better Explained: https://goo.gl/z28x2R

For those who want to learn more about the relationship between 1+2+3+4+... and -1/12, I'm quite fond of this blog post by Terry Tao: https://goo.gl/XRzyTJ

Also, in a different video ""What does it feel like to invent math"", I give a completely different example of how adding up growing positive numbers can meaningfully give a negative number, so long as you loosen your understanding of what distance should mean for numbers: https://youtu.be/XFDM1ip5HdU

Interestingly, that vertical line where the convergent portion of the function appears to abruptly stop corresponds to numbers whose real part is Euler's constant, ~0.577.  For those who know what this is, it's kind of fun to puzzle about why this is the case.

No, no es un deja vú. He eliminado el vídeo anterior y lo he resubido reparado.
Resulta que había cometido un error muy grave y no podía permitir que desde QF lo difundieramos. Mil gracias a un usuario (curtido en física) anónimo por percatarse y apuntarlo: 
Al hablar de los leptoquarks, os conté que eran los hipóteticos constituyentes de los leptones. MAL. MUY MAL. Nada que ver. Los leptoquarks son bosones que interactúan con leptones y quarks permitiendo la transmutación de unos en otros. Tal y como el W y el Z permiten la transmutación entre leptones y neutrinos.
Es un minsconception que llevaba arrastrando muchos años. Si alguno de vosotros ha visto mi intervención en The Wild Project, veréis que cometo el mismo error.
Desde aquí solo puedo pediros disculpas, esperar que este mensaje os llegue a la mayoría (aunque a YouTube no le guste mucho que suba vídeos repetidos) y prometeros que seré muchísimo más cuidadoso en próximas ocasiones.

For anyone who wants to understand the cross-product more deeply, this video shows how it relates to a certain linear transformation via duality.  This perspective gives a very elegant explanation of why the traditional computation of a dot product corresponds to its geometric interpretation.

Minor error at 1:44, the third line of the matrix should read ""v1 * w2 - w1 * v2""

*Note, in all the computations here, I list the coordinates of the vectors as columns of a matrix, but many textbooks put them in the rows of a matrix instead.  It makes no difference for the result since the determinant is unchanged after a transpose, but given how I've framed most of this series I think it is more intuitive to go with a column-centric approach.

Dot products are a nice geometric tool for understanding projection.  But now that we know about linear transformations, we can get a deeper feel for what's going on with the dot product, and the connection between its numerical computation and its geometric interpretation.

This introduces the ""Essence of linear algebra"" series, aimed at animating the geometric intuitions underlying many of the topics taught in a standard linear algebra course.
Error corrections: 
- At one point I mistakenly allude to calculators using the Taylor expansion of sine for its computations, when in reality most use CORDIC (or something like it).
- Around 30 seconds in, there is a typo in how the determinant is written, which should be ad - bc

No tenemos ni idea de qué es el 70% de lo que llena el universo. Hablo de la “energía oscura”. El motor que hace que se expanda cada vez más rápido. Y cuanto más se expande, más de esa sustancia parece haber. ¿De qué podría estar hecha? Hoy, igual que hicimos hace algún tiempo con la materia oscura, vamos a poner sobre el tapete todas las cosas que podría ser. O al menos algunas de las opciones más populares.

Hay un famoso argumento que nos dice que estar dentro de la simulación es lo más probable. ¿Es ya seguro que estamos dentro de un videojuego? ¿O tienen los filósofos mucho más que decir?

Ante el calentamiento global podríamos usar la tecnología para… ¿¿MODIFICAR EL CLIMA?? Sí. Hoy vamos a ver que podríamos combatirlo... ¡haciendo que el sol caliente un poquito menos! Aunque suene raro, esta sería una manera bastante rápida de enfriar el planeta. ¡Problema resuelto!... O ¿no? Vamos a verlo.

Cuando entras en contacto con algo, los electrones se repelen eléctricamente, creando un espacio que impide que jamás toques nada. Pero, ¿es esto verdad? Si no puedes tocar nada por la repulsión eléctrica, entonces ¿cómo puede tu mano mantenerse unida? ¿no deberían todos tus átomos saltar por los aires por culpa de los electrones? Veamos cómo la fuerza eléctrica más que separarnos nos une y que, si hay algo que de verdad no te permite tocar, es un efecto mucho más cuántico.

La fabulosa competición internacional en el que varios equipos luchan por un sueño: hacer que sus nanocoches, unas moléculas con un tamaño de 0.00000001 m, recorran la mayor distancia posible durante 24. No solo tienen que diseñar su molécula ganadora si no pilotar por un circuito de oro lleno de peligros usando microscopios de efecto túnel. Entrevistamos a David Écija, director técnico del equipo cocampeón de la carrera de 2022, al que le preguntamos todos los detalles de este interesante deporte. Además nos contará sobre la ciencia detrás de la carrera y los retos que plantea su campo.

Ese eclipse escondía un problema en el que no caerían los científicos hasta más de 1000 años después y cambiaría cómo medimos el tiempo. Un eclipse que abriría una rama de investigación que nos llevaría a entender mejor tanto el exterior como el interior de la Tierra.

Las supernovas son superconocidas. Sin embargo eso no es lo que le pasará al Sol. No habrá una gran explosión. Hoy os presentamos el flash de helio, un espectacular fogonazo que precederá a la muerte de nuestra estrella y que, paradójicamente, no podremos ver. ¿Cómo serán los últimos días del Sol? ¿Cómo afectará su muerte a la Tierra? ¡¿Cuánto tiempo nos queda?!

¿Y si te dijera que esta foto del sol está tomada de noche, con un telescopio que “apunta” hacia abajo, al suelo en vez de al cielo? La clave es que la imagen no está generada con luz, sino con unas partículas capaces de atravesar la Tierra. Hoy vamos a contaros qué aspecto tiene el universo cuando lo miramos con neutrinos.

"GEz0m1KLgXg","Albert Einstein, su Historia y su Ciencia Desconocida | Quantum FM #11 con Luis Navarro Veguillas","Albert Einstein, su Historia y su Ciencia Desconocida | Quantum FM #11 con Luis Navarro Veguillas","Albert Einstein es el científico por excelencia. Piensa en “científico” y verás a Einstein con bata. Pero, al margen de la cultura pop, es un personaje histórico de gran interés. Ya no solo por los numerosos descubrimientos científicos que alcanzó, no solo con la relatividad, sino impulsando la mecánica cuántica, la física estadística y otros campos. También por tener una biografía llena de giros y momentos fantásticos. Hoy entrevistamos a Luis Navarro Veguilla (posiblemente el mayor experto español en la figura de Einstein) para que nos cuente todos sus aspectos, también los más desconocidos. En especial le preguntaremos sobre la visita de Einstein a España, de la que se cumplen 100 años.

Su último libro, “El desconocido Albert Einstein”:

Luis Cortés Briñol","Liderado por Oppenheimer, el Proyecto Manhattan fue un esfuerzo científico y tecnológico sin precedentes durante la Segunda Guerra Mundial. Su objetivo era ambicioso: desarrollar la primera bomba atómica. En este fascinante viaje, exploraremos los eventos, las mentes brillantes, los dilemas éticos que rodearon este proyecto, los impactos históricos y las lecciones aprendidas que todavía resuenan en la sociedad actual. Y para ello nos acompaña Luis Cortés Briñol, que nos desmenuzará este momento histórico.

Hay aun muchas cosas que no sabemos de los seres vivos que allí viven y cómo afectan al planeta es un conjunto. Por otro lado, proteger la biosfera es uno de los retos del siglo XXI. Problemas medioambientales que no solo ocasionan la pérdida de montones de especies sino que, si nos lo frenamos, tendrán repercusiones políticas, sociales y económicas en todas las partes del mundo. 
Hoy nos acompaña Pablos Rodríguez Ros, doctor en ciencias del mar, para desvelarnos qué está ocurriendo y el papel de la política en todo esto. Espero que nos hable también de las montones de expediciones científicas que ha realizado (¡incluso a la Antártida!)

Sí, Sheldon Cooper trabajaba para ella. Una propuesta que mezcla gravedad con cuántica, que unifica todo nuestro entendimiento elemental del cosmos.
Sin embargo, probar experimentalmente que esta es la teoría que describe nuestro mundo es algo que está fuera de nuestro alcance. Sin embargo, algunos físicos están explorando una forma de conectar la teoría de cuerdas con el mundo real, un campo llamado La Ciénaga (Swampland). Miguel e Irene, unos rockstars de la física teórica, nos hablarán de todo esto.

La humanidad logrará la tecnología capaz de manipular la fuente de energía que usan las estrellas y se resolverán nuestros problemas energéticos. Sin embargo, la ciencia del asunto no es tan sencilla. En este episodio tendremos a uno de los expertos que trabajan en ITER (la organización internacional que está en camino de desarrollar la fusión en reactores Tokamak) para que nos hable de núcleos que se vuelven más ligeros al juntarse, de plasmas que se están creando en la Tierra a temperaturas mucho más altas que la del núcleo del sol, de la tecnología que es capaz de controlar estos plasmas y extraer energía de ellos, con muchos de sus detalles. No faltará hablar del desarrollo tan lento de esta fuente energética, sus problemas, de las startups que se están atreviendo a resolverlos y la iniciativa internacional que cada vez está más cerca de conseguirlo

Luis Cortés","Hoy orbitaremos entorno a la figura de Werner Heisenberg, el físico del que se inspira Walter White en Breaking Bad para obtener su pseudónimo. Una figura misteriosa que participó en el proyecto que intentó crear la bomba atómica nazi, un fracaso del que se piensa que Heisenberg fue el culpable. ¿Tal vez porque no era tan listo? ¿o por que saboteó el proyecto a propósito? También pasaremos por su intento de asesinato, la confrontación que tuvo con su maestro Niels Bohr, cómo su madre le salvó de ir a un campo de concentración, la enorme batalla que había en el momento por un tipo de agua algo especial, unos académicos que enjendraron una versión racista de la física e incidiremos en lo terriblemente difícil que es saber si Heisenberg fue un héroe o no.

06:22 Quinto Truco
07:28 Sexto Truco
08:22 Epílogo

🏆 Bases del Concurso: el #RetoMatemagia 🏆

1. Te recuerdo el reto: en formato audiovisual, explicar por qué una o varias de las demostraciones matemáticas aquí mostradas son falaces. No solo hay que apuntar que paso de la demostración es el erróneo, sino describir por qué lo es. 

2. Se que a algunos os sobra la creatividad y me presentaréis vuestros resultados como si fuera una superproducción de Hollywood (¡y creedme que lo valoraré!), pero si quieres participar no tienes por qué complicarte la vida. Con que coloques tu móvil en un sitio fijo y grabes una hoja de papel o una pizarra explicándolo es suficiente. También respetamos la vergüenza y la privacidad de todos los participantes, así que si quieres no aparecer en cámara y que se escuche tu (preciosa) voz, ¡adelante!

3. Publica el vídeo en YouTube y escribe en descripción del mismo, en cualquier lado, ""#RetoMatemagia"". Debería aparecer en azul justo encima del título del vídeo (como en este!). Asegúrate que está en modo ""público"", si no, ¡no lo encontraré cuando busque a todos los participante!

4. Añade a la descripción también un correo de contacto para que, en el posible escenario en el que seas uno de los ganadores, podemos hablar contigo para felicitarte y mandarte las láminas al sitio que indicas. Si os da apuro poner vuestro correo de toda la vida ahí a la vista de cualquiera, podéis haceros una cuenta provisional para esto e irla comprobando durante las próximas semanas. Solo queremos tener una manera de contactar con vosotros.

5. Los vídeos ganadores saldrán como protagonistas en el futuro vídeo de resolución del reto, ¡estaréis a los ojos de todos los suscriptores de QuantumFracture! Al igual que los nombres/nicks que nos hayáis proporcionado. Os repito: si os da vergüenza o valoráis mucho vuestra privacidad tomad las medidas oportunas en vuestro vídeo. No quiero que sea un experiencia desagradable para vosotros :(

6. Tenéis de plazo hasta el domingo 20 de Septiembre a las 23:59. Voy a ser estricto! Los vídeos publicados después de esa fecha ¡no cuentan!

7. Pizza + Piña = So Good

FE DE ERRATAS: en 5:31 digo ""billones de años luz"". ¡Error! Son billones de KILÓMETROS. Los debí confundir al escribir el guión y se nos pasó desde entonces. Los exoplanetas que vemos están por lo general a centenares/miles de años de luz de distancia de la Tierra. Aun así, el más lejano que se ha encontrado (usando precisamente el método de microlente) es el evento PA-99-N2, un posible planeta ubicado en la galaxia de Andrómeda, a unos 2 millones de años luz de aquí.

FE DE ERRATAS: en 4:34 os muestro como los pistones debajo del espejo primario se mueven para deformarlo a tiempo a real. ¡Me equivocaba! Al menos por lo general, es el espejo secundario (el que está arriba) el que se deforma de esta manera. Es más pequeño, por lo que se puede ser más fino al deformarlo. ¡Mil gracias a Basajaun por el chivatazo!

FE DE ERRATAS: Realmente a la astro fotografía no le quedaba tanto. Es cierto que hasta principios del siglo XX no hubo telescopios construidos a propósito para generar fotografías, pero mucho antes se habían utilizado daguerrotipos y técnicas similares para recoger eclipses y estrellas muy brillantes (como Vega). Claro que el supuesto Vulcano tenía que ser en principio tan débil que pillarlo con estas ténicas era imposible.

Un fabuloso libro para entender con dibujos todo lo que ha ocurrido en el vídeo y además tener una maravillosa herramienta para comprender la Relatividad Especial es ""An Illustrated Guide to Relativity"" de Tatsu Takeuchi.
https://www.cambridge.org/core/books/an-illustrated-guide-to-relativity/3503D181BAA103D82EE4A44A35389011

Pero si queréis tirar por un aprendizaje más clásico (y también necesario) os dejo un par de libros clásicos:

Special Relativity (MIT Introductory Physics), A.P. French
https://www.iberlibro.com/9780393097931/Special-Relativity-M.I.T-Introductory-Physics-0393097935/plp

Classical Mechanics, Herbert Goldstein, Charles Poole y John Safko
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classical_Mechanics_(Goldstein_book)

El artículo de Wikipedia sobre las comprobaciones constante de que la velocidad de la luz es universal para todos los observadores 
(es decir, que se mantiene la invarianza Lorentz; que no se produce una violación lorentziana) es bastante completo. Aunque podrías estar mejor actualizado:
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modern_searches_for_Lorentz_violation

Un fabuloso libro para entender con dibujos todo lo que ha ocurrido en el vídeo y además tener una maravillosa herramienta para comprender la Relatividad Especial es ""An Illustrated Guide to Relativity"" de Tatsu Takeuchi.
https://www.cambridge.org/core/books/an-illustrated-guide-to-relativity/3503D181BAA103D82EE4A44A35389011

Pero si queréis tirar por un aprendizaje más clásico (y también necesario) os dejo un par de libros clásicos:

Special Relativity (MIT Introductory Physics), A.P. French
https://www.iberlibro.com/9780393097931/Special-Relativity-M.I.T-Introductory-Physics-0393097935/plp

Classical Mechanics, Herbert Goldstein, Charles Poole y John Safko

Por si queréis aprender más sobre este experimento de la mano de Richard Feynman:
http://www.feynmanlectures.caltech.edu/III_01.html

Los físicos que aquí aparecen los he escogido de manera arbitraria. Realmente la mecánica cuántica fue construida por muchísimos grandes científicos. Bien podrían haber salido gente como: Max Planck, Niels Bohr, Werner Heisenberg, Louis de Broglie, Arthur Compton, Albert Einstein, Erwin Schrödinger, Max Born, John von Neumann, Paul Dirac, Enrico Fermi, Wolfgang Pauli, Max von Laue, Freeman Dyson, David Hilbert, Wilhelm Wien, Satyendra Nath Bose, Arnold Sommerfeld, Álvaro Ojeda...

Un pequeño detalle: en la realidad si ejecutas el experimento y haces el juego de separar las cajas, cuando las alejas, las concentracion no se alejas; se juntan. Y al contrario, si juntas las cajas, las concentraciones se alejan. Es algo contra intuitivo, pero está bien explicado cuando estudias la interferencia que se produce. Podéis ver los número aquí:

BASES DEL CONCURSO:

1. El reto: Reflexionar sobre los cinco argumentos terraplanistas y decir por qué es tan mal. Por favor, no hagas disertaciones de 30 páginas sobre cada argumento ni te pongas a divagar: responde de manera breve, clara y afilada. Si realmente sabes de que pie cojean, en tres frases puedes resolverlo.

2. Manda las respuestas en un email a la dirección: qfracture@gmail.com. MUY IMPORTANTE: Pon en el asunto literalmente “Reto Tierra Plana”. Si el asunto no es ese no leeré tu respuesta, por lo que no entrarás dentro del reto. Chicos pls, ponedme en el asunto “Reto Tierra Plana”.

3. ¡La primera persona gana! En cuanto reciba el correo ganador, lo publicaré en todas mis redes sociales: Twitter, Facebook y Instagram. Así que estad atentos a alguna de ellas para ver si vuestro correo ha sido el afortunado… O si habéis llegado demasiado tarde :(

4. Tenéis de plazo hasta el jueves 20 de Abril a las 19:00… Aunque estoy seguro de que seréis más rápidos.

CÓDIGOS E INSTRUCCIONES     ------------------------------------------------

En cada uno de estos documentos tenéis listos los códigos en C++ para copiar y pegar:

POLÍGONOS: 
https://docs.google.com/document/d/1NtpaNDxD6KHn7PYRUwNpE46LWRMBlCwDFKODrPHmYRo/edit?usp=sharing

MONTECARLO: 
https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Ud_FCbVrxJoowz7rW2-FsJ3VTSoDjUQbaqvFkAxquFs/edit?usp=sharing

BASILEA:
https://docs.google.com/document/d/1tq7KkGEQnmfIGKRi0pX0mlrYQrgdlq0iqvgflK4JP6w/edit?usp=sharing

Bien, ahora, INSTRUCCIONES:

1) Abre un COMPILADOR ONLINE cualquiera, el que más te guste. Yo te recomiendo este: http://ideone.com/

2) Entra en uno de los códigos que he escrito (links aquí arriba), seleccionalo TODO (un atajo del teclado: ""ctrl + A"") y copialo (""ctrl + C"").

3) Ve a la pagina del compilador online. En la ventana en la que haya que poner el código, BORRA LO QUE HAYA, y pega (""ctrl + V"") el mio.

4) Ahora te toca jugar a ti: dentro de cada código, he puesto en una parte una barras llamativas estilo ""/////////////"" y un texto que pone ""¡CAMBIAD ESTO!"". Justo al lado, veréis una ""N"" o una ""n"" igualando un cierto número. Yo he puesto por defecto 12345 para que veáis cuál es. Bien, ese número es, respectivamente, el número de lados del polígono, el número de dardos a lanzar y el número de términos a sumar.
Cambiadlo COMO OS DE LA GANA, probad con 100, 1000 o 10000... y veréis que cuanto más alto es, mejor es el resultado de pi. 

5) Una vez hayáis puesto ese número como os haya apetecido, activad el programa pulsando ""RUN"" (o ""COMPILE"", si estáis en otro compilador). 

6) Si bajáis abajo en la página ¡veréis vuestro resultado!

En el propio código podréis encontrar mucha información sobre cómo funciona. Sentiros libres de leerla si os interesa.

He descubierto toda esta historia en este artículo de Harry Nussbaumer, ""Einstein's conversion from his static to an expanding universe"" (La conversión de Einstein desde su universo estático hasta el universo en expansión). Si os interesa conocer los detalles, os recomiendo mucho leerlo; viene acompañado de cartas, entrevistas, borradores... que han servido para reconstruir la historia:

Muchas gracias a Sonia López Bravo por sus brillante ayuda. Sin sus espontáneas ideas este vídeo no sería el que es.

Remarco que en este vídeo no se ha desperdiciado comida. Para un día que hago hamburguesas… Por cierto, por si alguien quiere la receta, la aprendí (y la modifiqué) de este buen señor:
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8pI3qnLbWCo

Si queréis leer más sobre Relatividad, recomiendo:
""An Illustrated Guide To Relativity, Tatsu Takeuchi, editorial Cambridge"". Una manera visual de entender todos las situaciones de Relatividad. Sin duda, me parece el mejor libro sobre este tema que he leído. 
""Special Relativity, A.P. French, The MIT Introductory Physics Series"". Pocas ecuaciones, muchos experimentos y evidencias, y las ideas muy bien expuestas.
Está un poco feo decirlo, pero Wikipedia también mola mucho ;) (Sobre todo en inglés, que es más completa)

Y, cómo no, al gran @EverSalazar por echarme una vez más una mano con los dibujos de monigotes.

Y por último, pero no menos importante (en absoluto), gracias a Pablo Bueno por dedicar esos minutos a revisar que no digo ninguna burrada.

Todas los fenómenos aquí representados y animados no son (ni pretenden) ser precisas ¡Tienen un propósito meramente educativo!

Mi libro de referencia para hacer este vídeo ha sido ""Mark W. Zemansky, Richard H. Dittman, Heat and Thermodynamics"" que es bastante claro y bien ilustrado con experimentos. Existe otro libro que lo cuenta de una manera más teórica y matemática por si tiráis por ahí: ""Herbert B. Callen, Thermodynamics and an Introduction to Thermostatistics"".

Esto es una aclaración sobre la forma REAL de las órbitas. En el video las he exagerado para que parecieran muy elípticas, pero lo cierto es que los planetas cercanos al sol tienen órbitas prácticamente circulares (pero no del todo!). 
También aclarar que el tamaño de los astros que he puesto en el video... no son lo reales, no están a proporción.

Los colegas de Naukas se me adelantaron, y ya hablaron del tema: http://naukas.com/2013/12/03/y-si-la-tierra-fuera-hueca/

Este es el video implicado. 
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXDP0MqAg-A

El ""investigador"" JL, del canal mundo desconocido, da una charla sobre la teoría de la Tierra Hueca. En ella, se exponen un montón de argumentos de autoridad de científicos reputados y de científicos desconocidos (la mayoría falsos, no los he encontrado por ninguna parte), ideas físicas mal entendidas, y relatos de gente que ha visto el interior terrestre etc., todo esto con la ausencia total de referencias.

Mi parte ""favorita"" es cuando explica las auroras boreales como un tipo de reflexión de la luz del sol interno en las capas altas de la atmósfera (algo que ni siquiera sabe explicar, por cierto). Si esa es explicación, ¿como es posible que se hayan podido ver auroras en Roma, o en Madrid?.
Las auroras boreales son fenómenos muy bien establecidos. Se debe a reacciones del viento solar con moléculas de nuestra atmósfera. El campo magnético que rodea la Tierra repele el viento solar, pero en los polos se debilita, y el viento solar puede pasar y reaccionar con al atmósfera, creando las auroras. Si el viento solar es muy potente, o hay alguna debilidad del campo magnético, las auroras pueden aparecer lejos de los polos.

Me duele mucho que el canal de este hombre tenga tantos seguidores. He visto algunos vídeos donde se metía con temas de física, y tengo decir que tiene un lio... Tenia muchos errores de no haber entendido de lo que hablaba.
Me duele que por su ignorancia, confunda a sus seguidores. Muchas veces desprecia el trabajo de los científicos, creyendo que señores oscuros controlan las investigaciones.
En mi opinión, debería aprender que antes de hablar sobre algo, tienes que conocerlo bien.

Si os apetece, ¿Por que no vais a su canal, y le dejais algún mensaje de mi parte?

Una de las pruebas (que me parecen la más contundente) que muestran que la Tierra es maciza,  son las discontinuidades de las ondas sísmicas en el interior de la Tierra. 
Rápidamente: cuando hay terremoto se produce una onda que viaja por la roca. Estas ondas viajan por toda la Tierra, y se pueden detectar de una punta a otra del mundo. Lo que observas es que la onda cambia de velocidad varias veces en distintas profundidades. Esto se produce cuando una onda cambia de medio. Por eso sabemos que en el interior terrestre hay distintas zonas compuestas por distintos materiales, el manto, el núcleo etc.

Desde el canal El Traductor de Ingeniería (ETDI) creamos Matemática para la Gente con la idea de apoyar al sistema educativo y a todos sus integrantes, porque entendemos que hace muchos años transitamos una #EmergenciaEducativa que requiere acciones ya. Matemática para la Gente es una serie clases en vivo y en directo a través de YouTube en las que estudiaremos la matemática elemental que se enseña en el nivel obligatorio, pero esta vez para aprender la esencia, los conceptos y las ideas que te servirán para el día a día. Habrá docentes voluntarios que crearán salas de consulta libres en las que podrás participar para acompañar tus estudios. Trabajaremos con una guía de problemas que podrás descargar para practicar los conceptos vistos en clase. Trabajaremos un tema por semana.

Les dejo la resolución del último problema planteado, hecha por el amigo y colega Juan Ignacio del canal Álgebra para Todos: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-38nXUuXLQ


Fe de erratas:
1.- Errata en minuto 27 y 23 seg, copio mal, error de distracción. El lugar de escribir (x-3) escribo (x+3). Por lo tanto el dibujo no corresponde con la ecuación original. 

2.- Siendo bien bien finos con los nombres de las ecuaciones, podemos decir que en alguna bibliografía es posible que diferencien el concepto de ecuación canónica del de ecuación ordinaria de una circunferencia, llamado ordinaria a la ecuación:  (x-h)²+(y-k)²=r²   y canónica a:  x²+y²=r².

La profesora María Inés Baragatti, licenciada en matemática, dio clases durante más de cuatro décadas tanto en la Universidad Nacional de La Plata, como en la Universidad Nacional de Quilmes (Argentina). En 2014 se jubiló. Hasta el 2017 nunca hubo ningún registro de sus clases, solamente era recordada por sus exalumnos por enseñar matemática pensando y cuestionando los conceptos.

En 2019 se hizo una segunda clase. Y finalmente, ya en 2022, se pudo hacer una tercera clase presencial, dividida en tres partes, con una duración total de dos horas cuarenta y cinco minutos.

Libros que recomiendo para introducirse en este tema:
Estos tienen una breve Intro a vectores con un enfoque desde la física:
- Fisica Universitaria, Sears-Zemansky, 12va Edición, Ed. 
- Física para Ciencias e Ingeniería, Serway.Jewett, 7ma Edición, Ed. Cengage.  

Estos tienen una introducción bastante interesante al Álgebra Lineal:
- Cálculo Vectorial, Claudio Pita Ruiz
- Cálculo Vecorial, J. E. Marsden y A. J. Tromba

Video de funciones trigonométricas que les mencioné:
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WdfWMMrsCLo

Errores tontos pero que pueden traer confusión:
- Cuando escribí los conjuntos R, R2, R3, y Rn debí utilizar ""/"" en lugar de "","". Por ejemplo, debí escribir: R2={(x1, x2)/ x1, x2 ∈ R} en lugar de R2={(x1, x2), x1, x2 ∈ R}.
- Decir que R={x/ x ∈ R} es equivalente a decir R=R, no aporta mucha información.
- Al presentar las funciones vectoriales, debí escribir I ⊆ Rm en lugar de I ∈ Rm.

+ INFO (min 41)
Hay varias maneras de relacionar cualquier unidad (bien digo, CUALQUIERA) con las siete unidades básicas; dos de ellas son:
- Reescribiendo a la unidad en cuestión como producto de potencias de exponente real de las unidades básicas. Por ejemplo, m/s.
- Reescribiendo la unidad en cuestión como producto de alguna unidad básica y una constante. Por ejemplo: 1 pulgada = 0.025 * m 

Aclaración sobre las definiciones:
Las siete unidades básicas se definen tras haber fijado en un valor numérico determinado siete constantes físicas:
- La frecuencia de la radiación de la transición del estado hiperfino no perturbado del átomo de cesio-133.
- La rapidez de la luz.
-  La constante de Planck.
- La carga del electrón.
- La constante de Boltzmann.
- La constante de Avogadro.
- La eficacia de la radiación monocromática de 540 x 10^2 Hz.
Por cuestiones didácticas, no las presenté todas en el video. 
Cuando expongo una definición hecha por el sistema Internacional de Unidades utilizo el verbo ""definir""; en cambio, cuando expongo una consecuencia de una definición, utilizo el verbo ""establece"".

Observación:
La primera interpretación de masa que di, si bien suele ser una de las más difundidas, en rigor, no es la más adecuada. La segunda definición (pensando a la masa como una medida de inercia al movimiento) es las más correcta y por eso digo ""es la que más me gusta"".

Fe de errata:
- A los 25 seg. digo ""área de una circunferencia"", eso está mal. Debí haber dicho área de un círculo. La circunferencia es la curva que delimita un círculo. 

- Dije que el sistema de coordenadas rectangulares se llama así porque para localizar a un punto en el plano hay que hacer la construcción de un rectángulo. Eso no es así. En rigor, se llama rectangular porque los dos ejes son perpendiculares entre sí y forman cuatro ángulos rectos, uno en cada cuadrante.

- En el minuto 22 seg. 21 dije ""Cuantas veces entra OP' en OA"", en realidad, si bien OP'=0.6 OA, lo correcto es decir, ""Cuántas veces entra OA en OP'"", ya que la unidad de medida es OA. De todos modos en el cartel se aclara perfectamente. Respecto al término ""veces"" podemos decir que es un abuso del lenguaje (una licencia didáctica), ya que el término veces solo es rigurosamente válido cuando trabajamos con números naturales.

Respuesta a la pregunta ¿por qué estudiamos circuitos ideales si estos no existen?:
Los resultados obtenidos del análisis de circuitos ideales se aproximan (en muchos casos) muy bien a los encontrados en la realidad, es decir, el error cometido es, en general, despreciable.

Dato: Si bien suponer que los conductores tienen resistencia nula, en general, es una buena aproximación, hay casos en que esto no funciona del todo bien. Por ejemplo, cuando se realizan mediciones de resistencias de muy bajo valor es necesario considerar la resistencia de los cables no nula para que las mediciones tengan un error aceptable. Otro ejemplo: cuando se diseñan pistas en circuitos impresos, a veces es necesario considerar la resistencia de las pistas para garantizar corrientes precisas en los componentes. Hay infinidad de aplicaciones en ingeniería que requieren modelos más complejos que el ideal. 

Video donde explico por qué la fórmula para la resistencia equivalente de un paralelo es como es: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5iT9yhqmk4

En el modelo de variable real mostrado al final, se consideró una condición inicial igual a la unidad. Si queres saber más sobre ecuaciones diferenciales te recomiendo el vídeo sobre el tema que tengo en el canal.

Este modelo muestra como evoluciona la cantidad de casos confirmados de Covid-19 en una población dada. Sirve para entender cuáles son algunas de las variables de infuencia y como con nuestros actos podemos frenar en avance la pandemia. No se consideran casos recuperados ni muertes, solamente los casos confirmados. Tampoco se consideran tiempos de incubación ni medidas de restricción. Es un modelo bastante simplificado que solo sirve para tomar conciencia del orden de magnitud que puede tener un avance exponencial y no controlado de la pandemia. Existen modelos mucho más complejos que se ajustan mejor a la realidad.

Observaciones/Fe de Erratas:
- En 7-50 aparece T(x,y,x,t), deberia ser T(x,y,z,t). Error de edición.

- El modelo para el crecimiento de bacterias presentado es de variable real. Por lo general los modelos reducen la realidad simplificando el tratamiento y considerando solo algunos aspectos y no otros. Los resultados suelen ser aproximaciones a la realidad. En este caso, P(t) toma valores reales que podrían aproximarse a la cantidad de bacterias en el instante de tiempo t. Que tan bien se aproxime depende del tipo de experimento y del tipo de modelo. Si se considerara la parte entera de cada valor que toma P(t), eso podría, bajo ciertas hipótesis, representar a la cantidad en cuestión.

- 49-42 la contante k1 es estrictamente positiva

- 1-01-24 esa cantidad de sal, en la práctica, no alcanza a diluirse. Considero que la solución entrante ingresa con precipitado de sal y sale en forma homogénea. Este problema te invita a investigar sobre saturación de soluciones, te invita a pensar. También el caudal de salida en la práctica es imposible que sea constante. Lo supondremos constante para simplificar el modelo. Terminará siendo una aproximación, como cualquier modelo.

- En 1-12-08 se siguió usando dt, cuando debió pasarse a usar du.

En el video no se estudió la continuidad de la función (pese a que aparece por error el letrero ""continuidad""). 

La función presentada en el video es continua porque la continuidad de una función se estudia en el dominio de la función. Por lo tanto, en el ejemplo, la función por ser racional es continua en todo su dominio, por lo tanto se declara: ""continua"".

Lo que suele enseñarse en algunos libros y en las aulas mismas es diferente: ""La continuidad de una función f(x) se estudia para todo x, sin importar si x pertenece al dominio de f(x) o no"". Por lo tanto en el ejemplo, para x=0, la función ""no es continua"", a pesar de que x=0 no pertenece al dominio de f. Esto es incorrecto.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Dedicado a quienes quieren aprender de verdad. Veremos una introducción motivadora para comenzar a entender como procedemos para estudiar funciones de variable real a valores reales. Cálculo en su máximo esplendor.

Para entender, los videos anteriores debes ver:
- Funciones: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ojiMGOqwwCE

- Funciones inversas (ejemplo): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBk1BYLb2M4

Aclaración de 7:00 : Hay que conocer muy bien como se definen las distintas funciones para identificar las restricciones que estas imponen. En adición a las presentadas en el video, podemos mencionar que la base de cualquier logaritmo debe ser positiva y distinta de 1.  

Aclaro que es posible conocer puntos notables de la función, como cruces a los ejes x e y de la siguiente manera:
    Cruces al eje y: corresponde evaluar a la función con x=0, siempre que x=0 pertenezca al dominio de f(x).
    Cruces al eje y: como se tiene y=f(x), en los posibles cruces al eje x la función tomaría el valor y=0, por lo tanto se puede plantear f(x)=0 para averiguar las abscisas para las cuales f(x) toma el valor cero y por lo tanto x para los cuales la gráfica de f(x) ""cruza"" al eje x.

Pregunta que deberías hacerte:
¿Por qué Damián enseña a verificar máximos y mínimos a través de la primera derivada, evaluando a izquierda y a derecha del valor crítico de interés?¿Por qué no lo enseña evaluando la segunda derivada? 
Rta.: Porque la segunda derivada no siempre existe. El máximo o mínimo puede darse en puntos en los que la gráfica de f(x) es derivable (curva ""suave"") o bien en puntos angulosos (donde la derivada NO EXISTE). Si la primer derivada no existe, la segunda menos!. En esas situaciones EXISTE máximo o mínimo, pero el criterio de la segunda derivada no se puede aplicar. En otras palabras, el criterio de la 2da derivada NO SIEMPRE ES APLICABLE.

-  En el ejemplo planteado, se omitió la comprobación de que el valor encontrado corresponde a un máximo y no a un mínimo. Debió hacerse a través de la primera derivada evaluando con abscisas a derecha y a izquierda del valor crítico encontrado. También se omitió la comprobación de que el valor crítico encontrado satisface la condición impuesta por la restricción: x positivo.

- ¿Cómo podríamos darle un poco de formalidad a lo que vemos?.
- ¿Aparece la función sen(x), cos(x), ambas o ninguna?
- En todo caso, ¿dónde estaría el ángulo x?
- La proyección de la sombra (lo que vemos), y la proyección de funciones de un espacio a un sub-espacio, ¿realmente no tienen NADA que ver?
- ¿El sentido de giro de la rueda no está ""al revés"" de lo que la intuición sugiere?
- ¿Podría interpretarse una función de variable real a valores complejos sobre la rueda?
- ¿En qué parte de la rueda se mide la amplitud de la sinundoide? ¿qué relación tiene con el módulo de la función compleja del inciso anterior?
- ¿La velocidad de la rueda es igual a qué? ¿a la ""pulsación"" o ""frecuencia angular"" de la exponencial compleja que puede interpretarse sobre la rueda?
- ¿En la realidad, la velocidad de la rueda se mantuvo constante mientras grafico en la pared? ¿Entonces qué es lo que cambia de la función de la pared? ¿su periodo? ¿su frecuencia? ¿ambos?
- ¿Interesa conocer ""el origen"" o referencia inicial para declarar si la función es seno o coseno?

Para entender este video, es indispensable que hayas entendido y razonado los siguientes conceptos:
- Funciones de una variable real.
- Álgebra elemental.

Conceptos explicados en este video:
- Idea intuitiva de aproximación.
- Idea intuitiva del concepto de límite.
- Límites laterales. Existencia de límite.
- Asíntotas de una función.
- Ejemplo: f(x)=-1/(x-2)
- Límites por evaluación directa.
- Leyes de los límites.
- Ejemplo: f(x)=(x-1)/(x-3)
- Ejemplo: f(x)=(x^2-1)/(x-1)
- Teorema de la compresión (o del ""sandwich"").
- Ejemplo: f(x)=sen(x)/x
- Definición formal de límite (definición ""épsilon-delta"").

- Ron Larson, Bruce H. Edwards, Cálculo 1 de una variable, 9° edición, editorial Mc Graw Hill.

Observaciones ó errores de este video:
- Al presentar la definición formal de límite, aparece |f(x)-L| mayor que cero. En realidad corresponde poner mayor o IGUAL a cero, ya que si f(x) es constante e igual a L en el entorno reducido de x=a, ocurre que f(x)=L, entonces |f(x)-L|=0.
- En minuto 57, segundo 05 al dividir por x, habría que haber tenido en cuenta el posible signo negativo de x, eso cambia la desigualdad.
- En hora 1, minuto 13, segundo 39 en el fondo aparece escrito: para todo delta mayor que cero. No hagan caso a eso.

- Funciones de una variable real.
- Límites.

ACLARACIONES SOBRE ESTE VIDEO:
En algunas funciones, para algunos valores de x, el límite del cociente incremental no existe. En esos casos se dice que la derivada NO EXISTE en esos valores de x, y en consecuencia, la función f(x) no es ""derivable"" en esos valores de x. Es común presentar el ejemplo de una función con ""puntos angulosos"" como módulo de x: f(x)=|x|. Esa función en x=0 no es derivable.

Es importante remarcar que lo mostrado en este video fue concebido para aproximar al espectador al entendimiento de las ideas generales del tema. 
Cuando se habla de espectro de una señal no determinística (como ruido, o señal de frecuencia variable), NO CORRESPONDE hablar de Transformada de Fourier, en su lugar, lo correcto es hablar de Densidad Espectral de Potencia (tema no tratado en este video).

¡Sin restricciones! ¡Sin memorizar largas fórmulas!

Muy importante que leas esto: 

La definición expuesta (no es la primera que surgió) es la que interpreta al seno y al coseno como FUNCIONES, cuyas gráficas son las ""popularmente"" conocidas. 
Dado un triángulo rectángulo, la aplicación del razonamiento de cociente entre catetos e hipotenusa es válido. Sin embargo, es posible generalizar el concepto de seno y coseno para ángulos no agudos. Esa interpretación es la presentada en el video.

ACLARACIÓN IMPORTANTE:
Para entender este video, es indispensable que hayas entendido el concepto de función numérica de variable real. 

Las funciones seno y coseno se definen a partir de un cociente. Tanto el numerador como el denominador dependen del radio de la circunferencia. Dependen de forma tal que el cociente de independiza de él. Entonces el seno o el coseno no dependen del radio. La calculadora lo estima para un radio cualquiera, pudiendo funcionar sin problemas para radio uno.

El entendimiento de las relaciones trigonométricas a través de triángulos rectángulos es válida sólo para ángulos agudos (menores a 90°). Sin embargo, se pueden hacer reducciones sobre ángulos no agudos para que el razonamiento a través de triángulos funcione. Ese conjunto de reglas se explican con una definición de seno y coseno diferente: la planteada en el video.

La tangente se puede definir como el cociente entre la ordenada y la abscisa del punto.","2018-06-06 12:41:34","es-419",279,505341,29790,"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/ArAd_VaW8uI/default.jpg",1078,"This are the details of a youtube video, generate a short summary in spanish of max 150 characters.

     Podemos aclarar que en electrotecnia identificamos a la unidad imaginaria con ""j"" para no confundirla con la corriente eléctrica.
     El gráfico de ejes cos() y sen() se llama ""espacio de señal"" y es un espacio vectorial donde las bases son las funciones sen(2pi ft) y cos(2pi ft). Cada punto representa una señal, y cada señal es un vector de ese espacio vectorial.

+ La derivada se puede usar, entre otras cosas, para:
     - Estudiar las variaciones de una función respecto a sus variables. 
     - Optimización de funciones. 
     - Cálculo y análisis del gradiente de una función de varias variables, para poder identificar máximos y mínimos en este tipo de funciones.
     - En el análisis de sistemas lineales, es muy útil para estudiar la respuesta dinámica de modelos para sistemas reales.
     - Planteando la derivada de funciones escalonadas, se puede dar lugar al uso de funciones generalizadas como la delta de Dirac (extremadamente útil en análisis teóricos de señales y sistemas).

+ La integral se puede usar para:
     - Calcular la probabilidad de que una variable aleatoria, o un conjunto de variables aleatorias, estén en una región de valores determinada. Se plantearán integrales simples, dobles, triples, cuádruples, etc. de la función de densidad de probabilidad, o función de densidad conjunta de probabilidad, según sea el caso.
     - Calcular energía eléctrica, intregrando la función de potencia instanténea temporal.
     - Calcular convoluciones, intercorrelaciones, promedios, energía, potencia, etc. de señales determinísticas.
     - Calcular momentos de diferentes órdenes (media, varianza, etc.) de variables aleatorias. 
     - Calcular momentos bivariados para un conjunto de variables aleatorias.
     - Representar al operador integral como un operador lineal en un sistema lineal.

+ Las matrices, entre otras cosas, se pueden usar para:
     - Plantear y resolver sistemas de ecuaciones lineales, sistemas de ecuaciones diferenciales, etc.
     - Plantear el análisis de sistemas de codificación de datos (por ejemplo codificación de canal, en comunicaciones digitales).
     - Reducir notablemente la notación de sistemas de ecuaciones.
     - Utilizar MATLAB con fluidez. (MATLAB significa ""Laboratorio de Matrices"").
 
+ Las ecuaciones diferenciales (no lo conté en el video) nos sirven para:
     - Modelar comportamientos de sistemas (esto es todo un mundo!).

+ La variable compleja, y/o los números complejos, entre otras cosas, se puede utilizar en:
     - Representación fasorial de señales.ç
     - Uso de modelo de envolvente compleja para representación de señales, constituyéndose a través de otras dos señales, una en fase y otra en cuadratura.
     - En las variables de las transformadas de Fourier y de Laplace. También en la transformada Z. Y otras también.
     - En transformaciones (funciones de variable compleja). Muy útil para transformar regiones de un plano en otras regiones, donde cada punto de una región se corresponde con un punto de la otra.
     - En el cálculo de integrales de variable real difíciles de resolver en al variable real, donde se descubre el resultado a través del cálculo de una integral de variable compleja.

SIN USO DE DISTRIBUCIONES:
Para que x(t) admita transformada de Fourier, es suficiente que se cumplan simultáneamente las siguientes condiciones:

- x(t) debe ser absolutamente integrable.
- x(t) en cualquier intervalo finito debe tener:
      - Un número finito de discontinuidades finitas.
      - Un número finito de máximos y un número finito de mínimos.
Con el uso de distribuciones es posible asociar una transformada de Fourier a señales que no cumplan las condiciones anteriores.

Lo que se planea en este video tiene aplicación cuando las magnitudes que se manipulan (a la entrada y salida del bloque analizado) son POTENCIAS. En caso de trabajar con tensiones o corrientes, al aplicar la definición del dB para potencias, la expresión final para tensiones o corrientes termina siendo otra. Ésta:  X(dB)=20 log(X/Xref), donde X es la magnitud a representar en dB y Xref es la cantidad de referencia. Se considera que de tratarse de un bloque, hay adaptación de impedancias a la entrada y salida.

I hate wasting, throwing away broken anything that can be fixed easily. Not only repairing will reduce waste and saves perfectly good resources, it saves you a ton of money! That is if the cost of repairing is not more than buying a new one, or maybe even sometimes?! I mean think about a functioning motor in a drill, the magnets, the gears!!! So much good stuff!! I stop rambling now.
